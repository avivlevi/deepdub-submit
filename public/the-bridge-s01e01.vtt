1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-Copenhagen Police.

2
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.630
-Do you know who she is?
-Yes.

3
00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.590
Excuse me. A woman insists on
speaking to the person in charge.

4
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.130
-Is she in Sweden or Denmark?
-I don't know.

5
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.800
She's Swedish, and the car came
from Sweden. I assume I'm in charge.

6
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.330
-Saga Norén. Can I help you?
-When will you let traffic through?

7
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.430
-It might take up to two hours.
-I haven't got two hours!

8
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.230
-Back up.
-Is someone's life in danger?

9
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.040
There's a heart for my husband
in Copenhagen.

10
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.160
He needs a heart transplant.
Let us through.

11
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.150
He'll have to wait.
I can't let anyone through.

12
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.640
-What's happened?
-Is there no other way through?

13
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.680
There ought to be
another way through.

14
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.170
-No one's answering any questions.
-Let me pass, please.

15
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.010
The Öresund Bridge to Denmark
is closed.

16
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.930
According to the police it will...

17
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.850
-It's Stefan Lindberg.
-Hi, it's Veronika.

18
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.270
-Sorry, did I wake you up?
-No, you didn't. How are you?

19
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.500
I can't sleep.
I've got a stomach ache.

20
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.600
-I see. How are the boys?
-They're asleep.

21
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.680
They don't understand
what's about to happen.

22
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.000
-Can we meet up?
-Now?

23
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.470
Of course.
Do you want me to come over?

24
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.310
-No. I'd rather go to your place.
-OK.

25
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.290
-I can go to the office.
-I'll see you there.

26
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.940
Give me everything from
when the car came on to the bridge.

27
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.210
One camera records at a time.
They're started manually.

28
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.110
My colleague
might have recorded something.

29
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.180
Hello! Stop! Stop!

30
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.560
-Stop! Stop!
-I allowed it.

31
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.870
-Why? This is a crime scene.
-I'm fully aware of that.

32
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:49.660
-We've got enough bodies.
-He wasn't dying.

33
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.720
-Are you a doctor?
-No, I'm a police officer.

34
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.480
-What's your name?
-Martin Rohde.

35
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.420
-Rohde?
-R, O, H, D, E.

36
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.140
-Have you got an ID?
-It was an ambulance.

37
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.370
The Chairman
of Malmö City Council is dead.

38
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.710
-What evidence was destroyed?
-Probably none.

39
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.260
Thank you.

40
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.550
Hello. Hi. Finally.

41
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.000
I wont operate on Göran, Charlotte.
I had wine with my dinner.

42
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.890
-At what time? Are you drunk?
-No, but that doesn't matter.

43
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.210
You promised to see us through this.

44
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.330
-Morten Krag is a very good surgeon.
-Better than you?

45
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.240
I'll decide
who my husband's surgeon is!

46
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.750
-I wont forgive you if it goes wrong.
-What if I do it and it goes wrong?

47
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.310
Then I'll never forgive myself.

48
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.420
-We're done, you can move her.
-You can take her away.

49
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.040
Bloody hell.

50
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.530
The autopsy on Kerstin Ekwall
is being performed.

51
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.490
-And the recordings?
-They'll deliver them tomorrow.

52
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.290
-What about the press?
-They know.

53
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.390
The radio said that it was a woman.
They don't know who it is.

54
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.710
-And the family?
-I'm on my way to see them.

55
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.240
You'll wake them up, and there
are children there. Tread lightly.

56
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.830
In what sense? Oh. There aren't
that many ways to say it.

57
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:36.630
-Just tread lightly.
-Listen, Hans...

58
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.370
She was chopped in half.

59
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.480
-Right above the hips.
-What the hell are you saying?

60
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.560
She was due to attend a conference
in Copenhagen this morning.

61
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.920
-Have you got more computers?
-No.

62
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.850
Are you taking them?
The children's as well?

63
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.030
-When did you last talk to her?
-She called yesterday.

64
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.080
-Do you know what time it was?
-I don't know.

65
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.150
Around half past six in the evening.

66
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.990
-Was she threatened?
-By whom?

67
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.800
I didn't say that she was,
I asked you.

68
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.740
Not really. She was a politician,
there were some calls and emails.

69
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.230
-Has she upset anyone lately?
-Lately...

70
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.470
She wanted to charge for
library loans. Some disapproved.

71
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.490
-That's foolish.
-Sorry, what?

72
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.130
Reading becomes a money matter.
Social differences will grow.

73
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.090
-Is that why she was...?
-We don't know why.

74
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.870
It's unlikely
that library fees caused it.

75
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.120
Why? Why did someone do this?

76
00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.810
Can you think of something personal?
Was she in debt? Did she use drugs?

77
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.580
Did she have an affair?

78
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.990
Saga Norén.

79
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.060
Can't we talk on the phone?

80
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.530
I'll be there in twenty minutes. Bye.

81
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.450
August?

82
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.290
-Were you on the bridge?
-Yes.

83
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.350
-What happened?
-A murder, the Swedes will handle it.

84
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.200
-Did you check on August?
-Yes.

85
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.120
-Is he asleep?
-Yes.

86
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.230
You promised to talk to him.
He's become a night owl.

87
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.040
Do you want me to
wake him up now?

88
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.670
-He got up at three o'clock today.
-I'll have a word with him tomorrow.

89
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.790
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

90
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.030
-Do you know the cause of death?
-I can make a qualified guess.

91
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.010
She died six to eight hours ago.

92
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.300
Yes, she called home at six thirty
and was dumped just after midnight.

93
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.520
There's something else.

94
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.200
-What?
-Take a look.

95
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.980
No livor mortis on the ears.
That's consistent with the bleeding.

96
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.730
Petechiae on the conjunctivas.

97
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.110
The face is swollen.

98
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.190
She was strangled
and cut in half after death.

99
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.990
And the other half?

100
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.610
The lower body is much paler.
A lot paler.

101
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.470
It's not coherent with the bleeding
or how the body was placed.

102
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.690
There's brown discoloration.
Frostbite?

103
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.110
It feels different. Frostbite.

104
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.870
Not frostbite, deep-freezing.

105
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.100
For about a year, I think.
I've never seen anything like this.

106
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.390
I don't know who they belong to.
They're not Kerstin Ekwall's legs.

107
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.970
-So everyone's here, then.
-Yes.

108
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.510
Hi, Sebastian.

109
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.330
I don't know what to do.

110
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.410
I'm worried about tomorrow.
I had to see you.

111
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.220
Can't you just pay the rent?

112
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.700
They can't evict the children.
Can they? Their friends are there.

113
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.540
I paid out money for the rent.

114
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.090
-Why did you bring the children?
-Sören wasn't there.

115
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.100
I can't manage.

116
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.510
-Can't you make an exception?
-No. You know I can't.

117
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.520
-Please.
-There are guidelines. I'm sorry.

118
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:43.970
Charlotte Söringer? I'm Frederik
Henriksen, hospital administrator.

119
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.850
-Göran had atrial fibrillation.
-They managed to stop it.

120
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:46.930
-He's to weak for surgery.
-Too weak?

121
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.150
-But there's a new heart.
-It will be given to someone else.

122
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.490
Anders said
that you need a new CT scanner.

123
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.110
My husband's business is doing well.
He's willing to donate a CT scanner.

124
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.920
We're cancelling for his own sake.

125
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.280
He'll die without a new heart.
I want both parties to benefit.

126
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.960
Pass my offer on
to the proper authority, please.

127
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.300
-Hello? Is this Martin Rohde?
-Yes.

128
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.470
-It's Saga Norén from the bridge.
-Yes, I remember.

129
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.160
-Were you asleep?
-I tend to doze off around this time.

130
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.050
-There were two women.
-You found another one.

131
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.020
The lower body
belonged to someone else.

132
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.320
-Have you found half a body?
-I don't know.

133
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.850
It could be more than a year ago.
The legs have been deep-frozen.

134
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.050
-Can you look into it? Now?
-First thing tomorrow morning.

135
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.270
Can someone else
look into it straight away?

136
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.000
-I'll call you back.
-When?

137
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:15.530
-Do you have to get up?
-Yes.

138
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.530
Missing woman, Caucasian,
at least a year ago...

139
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.230
-How old?
-Adult.

140
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.270
-And life in general is OK?
-Yes.

141
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.990
-What about you?
-I'm fine.

142
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.810
-So you'll be firing blanks.
-Was it in the staff news bulletin?

143
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.250
-Is everything working as it should?
-It will in time.

144
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.930
It can't be much fun.

145
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.160
-What do you mean?
-You've heard about castrated toms?

146
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.860
A wild predator turns into
a chunky sleepyhead. Just like that.

147
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.750
They're castrated,
that's not the same thing.

148
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.920
Let's see what we've got.

149
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.220
Two women killed a year apart.

150
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.470
One was deep-frozen.
They were dismembered.

151
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.130
And assembled on the bridge.
Someone wants to make a statement.

152
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.900
-Saga Norén.
-It's Martin.

153
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.400
The lower body is Monique Brammer,
I think. A missing 23-year-old.

154
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.210
-Can you email the info?
-I'll be right over.

155
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.230
-Why do you want to come here?
-She's Danish.

156
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.440
I was first on the scene.
Everyone's still asleep here.

157
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.310
-Do you mind if I come over?
-Yes.

158
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.470
Make sure I'm allowed in.
You've got my details.

159
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.350
Martin Rohde has probably identified
the second body. He's coming over.

160
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.520
-Is that a problem?
-Yes...

161
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:53.390
No, no.

162
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.880
If half of the body is Danish,
we have to cooperate.

163
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.650
I'll schedule a meeting
at half past five.

164
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.650
-Can you be ready by then?
-Yes.

165
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.230
It finally worked out.

166
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.720
-What did you just sign?
-Formalities.

167
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.380
-Whose is it?
-What?

168
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.010
The heart. Whose is it?

169
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.100
A man's. He's 25 or 26
and had a motorcycle accident.

170
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.320
-What's his name?
-I don't know. Does it matter?

171
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.990
No, I guess it doesn't.

172
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.300
-I'm scared.
-It will be fine.

173
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.080
Anders will operate, they're all
highly skilled. It will be fine.

174
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.010
I can't imagine life without you.

175
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.510
-I need to take Göran with me.
-Don't worry. You'll make it, honey.

176
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:24.270
-Hi.
-Hi.

177
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.110
-Hi! An early breakfast?
-No thank you.

178
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.520
-An email would have been faster.
-Yes, but not as pleasant.

179
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.280
-Where are you going?
-I'm coming in with you.

180
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.510
If it really is Monique Brammer,
we both have responsibilities.

181
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.230
Go straight on,
turn left, and register.

182
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.480
-Good morning. Coffee?
-No thanks, I've already had some.

183
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.850
I'm Martin Rohde.
I'll be working with Saga.

184
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.420
-Thank you. You need to register.
-I also need a card.

185
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.210
-My name's Felicia.
-Nice to meet you.

186
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:41.570
-That's it. This is for you.
-Thank you.

187
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.870
-And one of these is for you.
-Thanks! Ooh, Danish.

188
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:44.530
-See you later.
-I hope so.

189
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.390
-Where's Saga Norén?
-To the right. Bye!

190
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.270
Excuse me.

191
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.120
-Sit down.
-I'm afraid I can't.

192
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.640
-You make me nervous.
-OK, I can stand still.

193
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.960
-Why can't you sit down?
-My nether regions hurt.

194
00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.760
-I had a vasectomy yesterday.
-Right.

195
00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.630
I've got five children
with three different women.

196
00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:00.980
-Have you got children?
-No, why would I want to?

197
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.090
-I've never heard anyone ask that.
-Many should have.

198
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.270
Not you,
I'm sure you're a wonderful dad.

199
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:07.950
-Why aren't you off sick?
-I can't afford it. August moved in.

200
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.740
Well, it's not really about money.
It was a small procedure, I can work.

201
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:10.640
-You can't sit down.
-I can.

202
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.750
-I drove here.
-Pretend that the chair is a car.

203
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.000
Yes.

204
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.610
-No one wanted to solve the case.
-What do you mean?

205
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.490
Monique Brammer
was reported missing.

206
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.020
Two prostitutes and a neighbour were
interviewed. The case was shelved.

207
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.920
It fell between two stools.

208
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.200
She disappeared, or she was killed.
They didn't find a body.

209
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.350
The case was
supposed to be shelved.

210
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.570
I'm surprised it took two weeks.
Come with me.

211
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:28.970
Do you think I should?
I tried painkillers, but...

212
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.540
-Two computers?
-They know who it is now.

213
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.340
-Will Saga handle the case, Hans?
-Yes.

214
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.270
-That's good.
-And a Danish police officer.

215
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.060
-Does he know that she's a bit odd?
-If not, he'll soon find out.

216
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.420
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

217
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.670
-This is Martin Röhde.
-It's Rohde.

218
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:38.970
Not as when you say "fur".
Rohde, Foure...

219
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.960
-Have you read the file?
-Most people have just arrived.

220
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.030
Half of two female bodies were found.
One was Kerstin Ekwall.

221
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.810
The other one has been deep-frozen.
Martin?

222
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.170
It's probably the 23-year-old
Monique Brammer from Copenhagen.

223
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.390
A prostitute and an addict
that went missing 13 months ago.

224
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.030
Do you want me to repeat that?
A bit slower?

225
00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.180
Monique Brammer, 23 years old.
A prostitute and an addict.

226
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.080
She went missing 13 months ago.

227
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.650
-Right.
-The investigation was inadequate.

228
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.970
-Don't you agree?
-Yes. It was terrible.

229
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.080
But we found blood traces
in her apartment.

230
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.470
The samples are on their way
and can be compared to the body.

231
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.700
Before the bodies were dumped,
the power was cut for 48 seconds.

232
00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.720
Their trying to trace the signal.
Can you help them, Gry?

233
00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.740
-How was it done?
-Someone accessed a computer.

234
00:06:58.780 --> 00:06:59.220
Can you show me the fourth picture?

235
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:00.260
Use all the people you need. Gry?

236
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.640
Here's Ekwall's mobile number.
Get the phone records.

237
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.780
Check her computers.
Talk to John about passwords.

238
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.690
Anne?
Find out where she was abducted.

239
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:04.920
She left work half past six.
She had a car. Find it!

240
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.360
-Were they dumped from her car?
-No, a black Cadillac Escalade.

241
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.820
The image where the bridge
is seen from above.

242
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.180
-John can find the license number.
-What? Sure.

243
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.170
-What are you doing?
-I had an idea.

244
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.700
The orange line the body was on...
We discussed where she was.

245
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:12.550
Here's the Swedish-Danish border.

246
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:13.650
One half is in Sweden,
one is in Denmark.

247
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:14.760
-It's millimetre perfect.
-Tell me everything about the line.

248
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.390
Take paint samples.

249
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.960
Power cut, body halves, a politician.
We'll be in the public eye.

250
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.970
-Hi. Is Veronika at home?
-Yes.

251
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:27.860
-What do you want?
-I would like to talk to her.

252
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.100
-You can talk to me.
-I would if you were clean.

253
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:30.280
-What? I am clean.
-Hi, Veronika.

254
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.760
-Isn't it enough to have us evicted?
-The landlord did that.

255
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.670
-You're not helping.
-I'm trying. I'm trying really hard.

256
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.170
If you had been more dependable,
you wouldn't have to move.

257
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.600
-That was bloody stupid.
-Sören! Stop it!

258
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:40.200
What the hell?

259
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:42.480
Stop, you bastard!

260
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:44.990
Stop! Come out!

261
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:48.650
Sören! Stop it, Sören! Stop it!

262
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:49.570
-I hate that bloody bastard!
-Sören!

263
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:51.310
He's caused trouble all along.
It makes me so angry!

264
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.820
Let go of me.
Go to hell, you bloody idiots.

265
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:03.380
-How's the operation going?
-It hasn't started.

266
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.510
-Why? He was prepared hours ago.
-I don't know.

267
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:05.240
I'm afraid I have to go.

268
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.770
-Don't you know where he is?
-You probably know better than me.

269
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.210
We'll call you if we hear from him...
Let's go.

270
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.940
-I'm sorry about all of this.
-Stop apologizing for him.

271
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:11.840
He's an adult
and makes his own decisions.

272
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.470
Maybe you should do the same?
Sören put you in this position.

273
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.050
You spend your money wisely,
but can't if you're not given any.

274
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.460
You don't get the chance
to care for your boys.

275
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.030
-He hits you and the children.
-Hardly ever the children.

276
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:19.060
Hardly ever? That's not good enough.

277
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.150
He shouldn't hit any of you.

278
00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.100
You can get your life back on track.
Just you and the children.

279
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.140
Leave your husband
or nothing will change.

280
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:25.470
Think about it.

281
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.160
-Anders? What's going on?
-We've got a problem.

282
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.630
The donor was declared brain dead,
and a nurse spoke to his father.

283
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:32.990
The father changed his mind.
We can't have the heart. Göran!

284
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:39.890
Wasn't that the turn-off?

285
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.600
-Stefan? Wasn't that the turn-off?
-No, not today.

286
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.250
-Where are we going?
-You'll see.

287
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.120
Johan was nicknamed "The old bag".
He died a month ago.

288
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.990
No wife, no children, no debts,
no assets. The house was all he had.

289
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:55.000
It went to the local council.

290
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.250
It's Sören.

291
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.180
Come.

292
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.360
-Step inside.
-What about the children?

293
00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.080
They can stay outside a while longer.

294
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.970
-Where are we? Why are we here?
-Just go inside.

295
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.330
-Crime scene and meeting place.
-Have you worked here a long time?

296
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:17.920
-More than ten years?
-Yes.

297
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.040
-Are you from around here?
-From Malmö? No.

298
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.800
I'm from Copenhagen.
I was born there.

299
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.280
No wonder Ingmar Bergman
and Lars Norén are from Sweden.

300
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:24.550
-Are you related to Lars Norén?
-No.

301
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:25.790
We need to find the meeting place
and the crime scene.

302
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.010
Where did the perpetrator
meet the victim?

303
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.670
I've spoken to Copenhagen.
You'll cooperate on the deaths.

304
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.710
Here's info about your authority.

305
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:33.910
I know what applies to me
in Denmark.

306
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:35.300
-Can I have a word with you, Saga?
-Yes.

307
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:37.690
The report you filed
against Martin...

308
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:38.360
Yes, there's only one.

309
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.370
What do you suggest I do with it?

310
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.370
Don't you think
it will affect your cooperation?

311
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:41.480
-Do you think so?
-I think there's every chance.

312
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.780
-Will he dislike me?
-That might happen.

313
00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.340
Because of my report?
It doesn't have to affect the case.

314
00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.380
He let an ambulance through.
No life was in danger.

315
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.390
-I'm supposed to file a report.
-I'll handle the report.

316
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.050
-Yes, that's fine. Fine.
-I've got the car's license number.

317
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:48.900
It belongs to Daniel Farbé in Malmö.

318
00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:49.810
-The journalist?
-Yes, he's a journalist.

319
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.040
-Do you know who he is?
-Yes. I read his column.

320
00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:54.330
It's entertaining.

321
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.230
-You made me jump.
-I worked all night.

322
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.460
-I'm done for the week. Berlin next.
-You work all night.

323
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.360
Then you get down in Berlin.
How do you manage?

324
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.530
Get down?
How many children have you got?

325
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.450
Children that suck the life
out of you.

326
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.140
I haven't got children. No one says
"get down" any more. No one.

327
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.430
-Have fun.
-I will.

328
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:17.140
I downloaded
"Elephants in the Desert".

329
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.210
What do you want, Åke?

330
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.310
A hug, an award, an applause?
Would you like one?

331
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.050
-They're really cool. I like them.
-Yes, they were cool.

332
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:22.480
What?
Two weeks ago you really liked them.

333
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.070
And now you like them.

334
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:24.140
My daughter...

335
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.260
-She danced all afternoon.
-Sorry, I have to answer.

336
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.640
We'll have to continue this later.

337
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:30.360
You and the boys will disappear.

338
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.260
Your paperwork
and your debts are gone.

339
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.000
You can make a fresh start.
Do you understand?

340
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.190
You can make a fresh start.
There's cash and a mobile here.

341
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.870
But you can never see or talk to
your husband again.

342
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.470
He's their dad.
I have to let them see him.

343
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:39.550
Why? Why do they have to?

344
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.790
To get another beating?
To be scared and broke?

345
00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:43.350
Let him spend everything on drugs?
He'll ruin everything for you again.

346
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:44.410
People like him ruin things.

347
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.080
You don't know me.
Why are you doing this?

348
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:49.140
Because I can.

349
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.100
Bloody hell.

350
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.170
-Here's my car.
-Do you think it's him?

351
00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:11.430
He kept a body in a freezer
and killed a politician.

352
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:12.520
-He wouldn't use his own car.
-Nice car.

353
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.820
-Is the Swedish police paid well?
-No, the same as in Denmark.

354
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.250
Don't jump to conclusions
about my wages based on my car.

355
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:16.540
Maybe it was a gift?
Maybe I inherited it or had savings?

356
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:17.810
I hope your professional conclusions
are more valid.

357
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.100
Read this.
It's Daniel Ferbé's latest column.

358
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.390
-The one that's a good writer?
-No, I said he's entertaining.

359
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.060
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

360
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:34.790
Hello? What's going on?

361
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.140
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-A Cadillac has a bomb in it.

362
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.180
Is it a black Escalade?
It's tied to a double homicide.

363
00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.710
-Is the guy trying to kill himself?
-I don't think he was involved.

364
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.040
No, you're not going
anywhere near the place.

365
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:48.560
Help! Help!

366
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:49.450
-Take it easy.
-Please help me!

367
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:50.610
-Help me! Get me out!
-Calm down.

368
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:53.150
-Help me!
-The windshield is wired in.

369
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.140
The side windows are
connected to the electrical system.

370
00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.570
The glass seems OK,
but there are wires everywhere.

371
00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:58.210
We've got his contact details.

372
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:03.500
-What's going on?
-My mobile!

373
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.740
-Yes?
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

374
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.150
I need to know whether you were
on the bridge last night.

375
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.250
-What?
-Were you on the Öresund Bridge?

376
00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:08.360
I was working.
I was here all the time.

377
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:09.730
-How will you get me out?
-I don't know, that's not my job.

378
00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:10.840
-Do you know Kerstin Ekwall?
-Who?

379
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.770
Daniel? Did you do anything
apart from turn the key?

380
00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:13.150
No. Everything locked.
The countdown started.

381
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.980
-Hello?
-I'm talking to the bomb guy.

382
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:14.790
Chairman of the City Council
Kerstin Ekwall.

383
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:16.280
-Have you written about her?
-No, I don't know.

384
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.400
-Have you been tipped off about her?
-No! What is this?

385
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.100
Get me out! Please!

386
00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.260
Does anyone else
have a key to your car?

387
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.700
-No, I don't know.
-Can you reach it?

388
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.620
I don't want to die. Please.

389
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.940
-I don't want it to end like this.
-Daniel? You need to talk to me.

390
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:25.520
It skipped a minute.
What the hell did you do?

391
00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:27.310
It was three, now it's two.
It was three.

392
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.730
Come one, hurry up.

393
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.030
Where are you going?
Stay here! Please!

394
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.220
Please! Come back!
Where are you going?

395
00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:36.870
You need to talk to me.
Daniel? Daniel?

396
00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:37.840
Is it a big bomb?

397
00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:39.940
-I think so.
-You're not religious, right?

398
00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:40.650
You're an atheist?

399
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.210
Everything will just stop. The body
won't have time to register pain.

400
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.740
-Are you sure?
-Don't look at the clock. Listen.

401
00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.180
Do you know why your car
was used to dump two bodies?

402
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:47.670
-No.
-Think about it. Focus.

403
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:49.090
-Who did this to you?
-I've slagged so many people off.

404
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:53.310
Daniel? Are you still there? Hello?

405
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:00.680
It's clean.

406
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:03.740
Sorry about the drama, it's hard
to make oneself heard today.

407
00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:04.560
I assume I have your attention now.

408
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.200
Our part of the world would be
wonderful if we solved our problems.

409
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.070
I would like to
point out five in particular.

410
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.730
This is only a beginning. We've got
interesting times ahead of us.

411
00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:09.630
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-Copenhagen Police.

412
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:10.360
-Do you know who she is?
-Yes.

413
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.320
Excuse me. A woman insists on
speaking to the person in charge.

414
00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:13.860
-Is she in Sweden or Denmark?
-I don't know.

415
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:15.530
She's Swedish, and the car came
from Sweden. I assume I'm in charge.

416
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.060
-Saga Norén. Can I help you?
-When will you let traffic through?

417
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.160
-It might take up to two hours.
-I haven't got two hours!

418
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:19.960
-Back up.
-Is someone's life in danger?

419
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:20.770
There's a heart for my husband
in Copenhagen.

420
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:21.890
He needs a heart transplant.
Let us through.

421
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:22.880
He'll have to wait.
I can't let anyone through.

422
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.370
-What's happened?
-Is there no other way through?

423
00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:25.410
There ought to be
another way through.

424
00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:26.900
-No one's answering any questions.
-Let me pass, please.

425
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:30.740
The Öresund Bridge to Denmark
is closed.

426
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:31.660
According to the police it will...

427
00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.580
-It's Stefan Lindberg.
-Hi, it's Veronika.

428
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.000
-Sorry, did I wake you up?
-No, you didn't. How are you?

429
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.230
I can't sleep.
I've got a stomach ache.

430
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:41.330
-I see. How are the boys?
-They're asleep.

431
00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:42.410
They don't understand
what's about to happen.

432
00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:43.730
-Can we meet up?
-Now?

433
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:45.200
Of course.
Do you want me to come over?

434
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.040
-No. I'd rather go to your place.
-OK.

435
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.020
-I can go to the office.
-I'll see you there.

436
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.670
Give me everything from
when the car came on to the bridge.

437
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:52.940
One camera records at a time.
They're started manually.

438
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:53.840
My colleague
might have recorded something.

439
00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.910
Hello! Stop! Stop!

440
00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:56.290
-Stop! Stop!
-I allowed it.

441
00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.600
-Why? This is a crime scene.
-I'm fully aware of that.

442
00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.390
-We've got enough bodies.
-He wasn't dying.

443
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:59.450
-Are you a doctor?
-No, I'm a police officer.

444
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.210
-What's your name?
-Martin Rohde.

445
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.150
-Rohde?
-R, O, H, D, E.

446
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:03.870
-Have you got an ID?
-It was an ambulance.

447
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.100
The Chairman
of Malmö City Council is dead.

448
00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.440
-What evidence was destroyed?
-Probably none.

449
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:06.990
Thank you.

450
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:14.280
Hello. Hi. Finally.

451
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.730
I wont operate on Göran, Charlotte.
I had wine with my dinner.

452
00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:17.620
-At what time? Are you drunk?
-No, but that doesn't matter.

453
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.940
You promised to see us through this.

454
00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.060
-Morten Krag is a very good surgeon.
-Better than you?

455
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:20.970
I'll decide
who my husband's surgeon is!

456
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:22.480
-I wont forgive you if it goes wrong.
-What if I do it and it goes wrong?

457
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:24.040
Then I'll never forgive myself.

458
00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.150
-We're done, you can move her.
-You can take her away.

459
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:31.770
Bloody hell.

460
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:37.260
The autopsy on Kerstin Ekwall
is being performed.

461
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.220
-And the recordings?
-They'll deliver them tomorrow.

462
00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:39.020
-What about the press?
-They know.

463
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.120
The radio said that it was a woman.
They don't know who it is.

464
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.440
-And the family?
-I'm on my way to see them.

465
00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.970
You'll wake them up, and there
are children there. Tread lightly.

466
00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.560
In what sense? Oh. There aren't
that many ways to say it.

467
00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.360
-Just tread lightly.
-Listen, Hans...

468
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.100
She was chopped in half.

469
00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.210
-Right above the hips.
-What the hell are you saying?

470
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:49.290
She was due to attend a conference
in Copenhagen this morning.

471
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:50.650
-Have you got more computers?
-No.

472
00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:51.580
Are you taking them?
The children's as well?

473
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.760
-When did you last talk to her?
-She called yesterday.

474
00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:53.810
-Do you know what time it was?
-I don't know.

475
00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:54.880
Around half past six in the evening.

476
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:55.720
-Was she threatened?
-By whom?

477
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.530
I didn't say that she was,
I asked you.

478
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.470
Not really. She was a politician,
there were some calls and emails.

479
00:14:58.510 --> 00:14:59.960
-Has she upset anyone lately?
-Lately...

480
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.200
She wanted to charge for
library loans. Some disapproved.

481
00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:02.220
-That's foolish.
-Sorry, what?

482
00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.860
Reading becomes a money matter.
Social differences will grow.

483
00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.820
-Is that why she was...?
-We don't know why.

484
00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:05.600
It's unlikely
that library fees caused it.

485
00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:06.850
Why? Why did someone do this?

486
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.540
Can you think of something personal?
Was she in debt? Did she use drugs?

487
00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:09.310
Did she have an affair?

488
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:13.720
Saga Norén.

489
00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:14.790
Can't we talk on the phone?

490
00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.260
I'll be there in twenty minutes. Bye.

491
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.180
August?

492
00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:42.020
-Were you on the bridge?
-Yes.

493
00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.080
-What happened?
-A murder, the Swedes will handle it.

494
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.930
-Did you check on August?
-Yes.

495
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:44.850
-Is he asleep?
-Yes.

496
00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:45.960
You promised to talk to him.
He's become a night owl.

497
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:46.770
Do you want me to
wake him up now?

498
00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.400
-He got up at three o'clock today.
-I'll have a word with him tomorrow.

499
00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:52.520
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

500
00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:59.760
-Do you know the cause of death?
-I can make a qualified guess.

501
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:00.740
She died six to eight hours ago.

502
00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.030
Yes, she called home at six thirty
and was dumped just after midnight.

503
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.250
There's something else.

504
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:03.930
-What?
-Take a look.

505
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.710
No livor mortis on the ears.
That's consistent with the bleeding.

506
00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:13.460
Petechiae on the conjunctivas.

507
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:14.840
The face is swollen.

508
00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:16.920
She was strangled
and cut in half after death.

509
00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:17.720
And the other half?

510
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:20.340
The lower body is much paler.
A lot paler.

511
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.200
It's not coherent with the bleeding
or how the body was placed.

512
00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.420
There's brown discoloration.
Frostbite?

513
00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:25.840
It feels different. Frostbite.

514
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.600
Not frostbite, deep-freezing.

515
00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.830
For about a year, I think.
I've never seen anything like this.

516
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.120
I don't know who they belong to.
They're not Kerstin Ekwall's legs.

517
00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:35.700
-So everyone's here, then.
-Yes.

518
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:36.240
Hi, Sebastian.

519
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.060
I don't know what to do.

520
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.140
I'm worried about tomorrow.
I had to see you.

521
00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:39.950
Can't you just pay the rent?

522
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:41.430
They can't evict the children.
Can they? Their friends are there.

523
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:42.270
I paid out money for the rent.

524
00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:43.820
-Why did you bring the children?
-Sören wasn't there.

525
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:44.830
I can't manage.

526
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.240
-Can't you make an exception?
-No. You know I can't.

527
00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.250
-Please.
-There are guidelines. I'm sorry.

528
00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.700
Charlotte Söringer? I'm Frederik
Henriksen, hospital administrator.

529
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.580
-Göran had atrial fibrillation.
-They managed to stop it.

530
00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.660
-He's to weak for surgery.
-Too weak?

531
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.880
-But there's a new heart.
-It will be given to someone else.

532
00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:58.220
Anders said
that you need a new CT scanner.

533
00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.840
My husband's business is doing well.
He's willing to donate a CT scanner.

534
00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.650
We're cancelling for his own sake.

535
00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:02.010
He'll die without a new heart.
I want both parties to benefit.

536
00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.690
Pass my offer on
to the proper authority, please.

537
00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:10.030
-Hello? Is this Martin Rohde?
-Yes.

538
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:11.200
-It's Saga Norén from the bridge.
-Yes, I remember.

539
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.890
-Were you asleep?
-I tend to doze off around this time.

540
00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:13.780
-There were two women.
-You found another one.

541
00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:14.750
The lower body
belonged to someone else.

542
00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.050
-Have you found half a body?
-I don't know.

543
00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:17.580
It could be more than a year ago.
The legs have been deep-frozen.

544
00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:18.780
-Can you look into it? Now?
-First thing tomorrow morning.

545
00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:20.000
Can someone else
look into it straight away?

546
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.730
-I'll call you back.
-When?

547
00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:24.260
-Do you have to get up?
-Yes.

548
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:32.260
Missing woman, Caucasian,
at least a year ago...

549
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:32.960
-How old?
-Adult.

550
00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:34.000
-And life in general is OK?
-Yes.

551
00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:34.720
-What about you?
-I'm fine.

552
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.540
-So you'll be firing blanks.
-Was it in the staff news bulletin?

553
00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:37.980
-Is everything working as it should?
-It will in time.

554
00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:38.660
It can't be much fun.

555
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:39.890
-What do you mean?
-You've heard about castrated toms?

556
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:41.590
A wild predator turns into
a chunky sleepyhead. Just like that.

557
00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.480
They're castrated,
that's not the same thing.

558
00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.650
Let's see what we've got.

559
00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:45.950
Two women killed a year apart.

560
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:47.200
One was deep-frozen.
They were dismembered.

561
00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.860
And assembled on the bridge.
Someone wants to make a statement.

562
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.630
-Saga Norén.
-It's Martin.

563
00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.130
The lower body is Monique Brammer,
I think. A missing 23-year-old.

564
00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:53.940
-Can you email the info?
-I'll be right over.

565
00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:54.960
-Why do you want to come here?
-She's Danish.

566
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.170
I was first on the scene.
Everyone's still asleep here.

567
00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:57.040
-Do you mind if I come over?
-Yes.

568
00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.200
Make sure I'm allowed in.
You've got my details.

569
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.080
Martin Rohde has probably identified
the second body. He's coming over.

570
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.250
-Is that a problem?
-Yes...

571
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.120
No, no.

572
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.610
If half of the body is Danish,
we have to cooperate.

573
00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:04.380
I'll schedule a meeting
at half past five.

574
00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.380
-Can you be ready by then?
-Yes.

575
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.960
It finally worked out.

576
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.450
-What did you just sign?
-Formalities.

577
00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:18.110
-Whose is it?
-What?

578
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:18.740
The heart. Whose is it?

579
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:19.830
A man's. He's 25 or 26
and had a motorcycle accident.

580
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:22.050
-What's his name?
-I don't know. Does it matter?

581
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:23.720
No, I guess it doesn't.

582
00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.030
-I'm scared.
-It will be fine.

583
00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:27.810
Anders will operate, they're all
highly skilled. It will be fine.

584
00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:28.740
I can't imagine life without you.

585
00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.240
-I need to take Göran with me.
-Don't worry. You'll make it, honey.

586
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:33.000
-Hi.
-Hi.

587
00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:33.840
-Hi! An early breakfast?
-No thank you.

588
00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.250
-An email would have been faster.
-Yes, but not as pleasant.

589
00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.010
-Where are you going?
-I'm coming in with you.

590
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:39.240
If it really is Monique Brammer,
we both have responsibilities.

591
00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:40.960
Go straight on,
turn left, and register.

592
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:45.210
-Good morning. Coffee?
-No thanks, I've already had some.

593
00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.580
I'm Martin Rohde.
I'll be working with Saga.

594
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.150
-Thank you. You need to register.
-I also need a card.

595
00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:48.940
-My name's Felicia.
-Nice to meet you.

596
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.300
-That's it. This is for you.
-Thank you.

597
00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.600
-And one of these is for you.
-Thanks! Ooh, Danish.

598
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:53.260
-See you later.
-I hope so.

599
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:57.120
-Where's Saga Norén?
-To the right. Bye!

600
00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:01.000
Excuse me.

601
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:01.850
-Sit down.
-I'm afraid I can't.

602
00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.370
-You make me nervous.
-OK, I can stand still.

603
00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:05.690
-Why can't you sit down?
-My nether regions hurt.

604
00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.490
-I had a vasectomy yesterday.
-Right.

605
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:08.360
I've got five children
with three different women.

606
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:09.710
-Have you got children?
-No, why would I want to?

607
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:10.820
-I've never heard anyone ask that.
-Many should have.

608
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:13.000
Not you,
I'm sure you're a wonderful dad.

609
00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.680
-Why aren't you off sick?
-I can't afford it. August moved in.

610
00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.470
Well, it's not really about money.
It was a small procedure, I can work.

611
00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:19.370
-You can't sit down.
-I can.

612
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:20.480
-I drove here.
-Pretend that the chair is a car.

613
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.730
Yes.

614
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:26.340
-No one wanted to solve the case.
-What do you mean?

615
00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.220
Monique Brammer
was reported missing.

616
00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.750
Two prostitutes and a neighbour were
interviewed. The case was shelved.

617
00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:29.650
It fell between two stools.

618
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:30.930
She disappeared, or she was killed.
They didn't find a body.

619
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:32.080
The case was
supposed to be shelved.

620
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.300
I'm surprised it took two weeks.
Come with me.

621
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.700
Do you think I should?
I tried painkillers, but...

622
00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.270
-Two computers?
-They know who it is now.

623
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:40.070
-Will Saga handle the case, Hans?
-Yes.

624
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:41.000
-That's good.
-And a Danish police officer.

625
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.790
-Does he know that she's a bit odd?
-If not, he'll soon find out.

626
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:45.150
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

627
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:46.400
-This is Martin Röhde.
-It's Rohde.

628
00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.700
Not as when you say "fur".
Rohde, Foure...

629
00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:49.690
-Have you read the file?
-Most people have just arrived.

630
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:50.760
Half of two female bodies were found.
One was Kerstin Ekwall.

631
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.540
The other one has been deep-frozen.
Martin?

632
00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:52.900
It's probably the 23-year-old
Monique Brammer from Copenhagen.

633
00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:54.120
A prostitute and an addict
that went missing 13 months ago.

634
00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:55.760
Do you want me to repeat that?
A bit slower?

635
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:56.910
Monique Brammer, 23 years old.
A prostitute and an addict.

636
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:57.810
She went missing 13 months ago.

637
00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:59.380
-Right.
-The investigation was inadequate.

638
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.700
-Don't you agree?
-Yes. It was terrible.

639
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:02.810
But we found blood traces
in her apartment.

640
00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:04.200
The samples are on their way
and can be compared to the body.

641
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.430
Before the bodies were dumped,
the power was cut for 48 seconds.

642
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:06.450
Their trying to trace the signal.
Can you help them, Gry?

643
00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:07.470
-How was it done?
-Someone accessed a computer.

644
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.950
Can you show me the fourth picture?

645
00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:08.990
Use all the people you need. Gry?

646
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.370
Here's Ekwall's mobile number.
Get the phone records.

647
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:11.510
Check her computers.
Talk to John about passwords.

648
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:12.420
Anne?
Find out where she was abducted.

649
00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:13.650
She left work half past six.
She had a car. Find it!

650
00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.090
-Were they dumped from her car?
-No, a black Cadillac Escalade.

651
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.550
The image where the bridge
is seen from above.

652
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:17.910
-John can find the license number.
-What? Sure.

653
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:18.900
-What are you doing?
-I had an idea.

654
00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:20.430
The orange line the body was on...
We discussed where she was.

655
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:21.280
Here's the Swedish-Danish border.

656
00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.380
One half is in Sweden,
one is in Denmark.

657
00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.490
-It's millimetre perfect.
-Tell me everything about the line.

658
00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:24.120
Take paint samples.

659
00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.690
Power cut, body halves, a politician.
We'll be in the public eye.

660
00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:35.700
-Hi. Is Veronika at home?
-Yes.

661
00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:36.590
-What do you want?
-I would like to talk to her.

662
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:37.830
-You can talk to me.
-I would if you were clean.

663
00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:39.010
-What? I am clean.
-Hi, Veronika.

664
00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:40.490
-Isn't it enough to have us evicted?
-The landlord did that.

665
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.400
-You're not helping.
-I'm trying. I'm trying really hard.

666
00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.900
If you had been more dependable,
you wouldn't have to move.

667
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.330
-That was bloody stupid.
-Sören! Stop it!

668
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:48.930
What the hell?

669
00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.210
Stop, you bastard!

670
00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:53.720
Stop! Come out!

671
00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:57.380
Sören! Stop it, Sören! Stop it!

672
00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.300
-I hate that bloody bastard!
-Sören!

673
00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.040
He's caused trouble all along.
It makes me so angry!

674
00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.550
Let go of me.
Go to hell, you bloody idiots.

675
00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.110
-How's the operation going?
-It hasn't started.

676
00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:13.240
-Why? He was prepared hours ago.
-I don't know.

677
00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:13.970
I'm afraid I have to go.

678
00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:15.500
-Don't you know where he is?
-You probably know better than me.

679
00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.940
We'll call you if we hear from him...
Let's go.

680
00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:18.670
-I'm sorry about all of this.
-Stop apologizing for him.

681
00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.570
He's an adult
and makes his own decisions.

682
00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.200
Maybe you should do the same?
Sören put you in this position.

683
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.780
You spend your money wisely,
but can't if you're not given any.

684
00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:25.190
You don't get the chance
to care for your boys.

685
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:26.760
-He hits you and the children.
-Hardly ever the children.

686
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:27.790
Hardly ever? That's not good enough.

687
00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:28.880
He shouldn't hit any of you.

688
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:30.830
You can get your life back on track.
Just you and the children.

689
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.870
Leave your husband
or nothing will change.

690
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.200
Think about it.

691
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:38.890
-Anders? What's going on?
-We've got a problem.

692
00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.360
The donor was declared brain dead,
and a nurse spoke to his father.

693
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.720
The father changed his mind.
We can't have the heart. Göran!

694
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.620
Wasn't that the turn-off?

695
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:50.330
-Stefan? Wasn't that the turn-off?
-No, not today.

696
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:51.980
-Where are we going?
-You'll see.

697
00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:00.850
Johan was nicknamed "The old bag".
He died a month ago.

698
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.720
No wife, no children, no debts,
no assets. The house was all he had.

699
00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:03.730
It went to the local council.

700
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:06.980
It's Sören.

701
00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:08.910
Come.

702
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.090
-Step inside.
-What about the children?

703
00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:18.810
They can stay outside a while longer.

704
00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:21.700
-Where are we? Why are we here?
-Just go inside.

705
00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:26.060
-Crime scene and meeting place.
-Have you worked here a long time?

706
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:26.650
-More than ten years?
-Yes.

707
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:27.770
-Are you from around here?
-From Malmö? No.

708
00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:29.530
I'm from Copenhagen.
I was born there.

709
00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.010
No wonder Ingmar Bergman
and Lars Norén are from Sweden.

710
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.280
-Are you related to Lars Norén?
-No.

711
00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:34.520
We need to find the meeting place
and the crime scene.

712
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.740
Where did the perpetrator
meet the victim?

713
00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:40.400
I've spoken to Copenhagen.
You'll cooperate on the deaths.

714
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:41.440
Here's info about your authority.

715
00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.640
I know what applies to me
in Denmark.

716
00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.030
-Can I have a word with you, Saga?
-Yes.

717
00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.420
The report you filed
against Martin...

718
00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.090
Yes, there's only one.

719
00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:48.100
What do you suggest I do with it?

720
00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.100
Don't you think
it will affect your cooperation?

721
00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:50.210
-Do you think so?
-I think there's every chance.

722
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.510
-Will he dislike me?
-That might happen.

723
00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.070
Because of my report?
It doesn't have to affect the case.

724
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:54.110
He let an ambulance through.
No life was in danger.

725
00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:55.120
-I'm supposed to file a report.
-I'll handle the report.

726
00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.780
-Yes, that's fine. Fine.
-I've got the car's license number.

727
00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.630
It belongs to Daniel Farbé in Malmö.

728
00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:58.540
-The journalist?
-Yes, he's a journalist.

729
00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:01.770
-Do you know who he is?
-Yes. I read his column.

730
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.060
It's entertaining.

731
00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.960
-You made me jump.
-I worked all night.

732
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.190
-I'm done for the week. Berlin next.
-You work all night.

733
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:20.090
Then you get down in Berlin.
How do you manage?

734
00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:21.260
Get down?
How many children have you got?

735
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.180
Children that suck the life
out of you.

736
00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.870
I haven't got children. No one says
"get down" any more. No one.

737
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:25.160
-Have fun.
-I will.

738
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:25.870
I downloaded
"Elephants in the Desert".

739
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:26.940
What do you want, Åke?

740
00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.040
A hug, an award, an applause?
Would you like one?

741
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:29.780
-They're really cool. I like them.
-Yes, they were cool.

742
00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.210
What?
Two weeks ago you really liked them.

743
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:31.800
And now you like them.

744
00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:32.870
My daughter...

745
00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:34.990
-She danced all afternoon.
-Sorry, I have to answer.

746
00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:36.370
We'll have to continue this later.

747
00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.090
You and the boys will disappear.

748
00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:39.990
Your paperwork
and your debts are gone.

749
00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:41.730
You can make a fresh start.
Do you understand?

750
00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:43.920
You can make a fresh start.
There's cash and a mobile here.

751
00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:45.600
But you can never see or talk to
your husband again.

752
00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.200
He's their dad.
I have to let them see him.

753
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.280
Why? Why do they have to?

754
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:50.520
To get another beating?
To be scared and broke?

755
00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.080
Let him spend everything on drugs?
He'll ruin everything for you again.

756
00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.140
People like him ruin things.

757
00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:54.810
You don't know me.
Why are you doing this?

758
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:57.870
Because I can.

759
00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:09.830
Bloody hell.

760
00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:18.900
-Here's my car.
-Do you think it's him?

761
00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.160
He kept a body in a freezer
and killed a politician.

762
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.250
-He wouldn't use his own car.
-Nice car.

763
00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:22.550
-Is the Swedish police paid well?
-No, the same as in Denmark.

764
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:23.980
Don't jump to conclusions
about my wages based on my car.

765
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.270
Maybe it was a gift?
Maybe I inherited it or had savings?

766
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:26.540
I hope your professional conclusions
are more valid.

767
00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:27.830
Read this.
It's Daniel Ferbé's latest column.

768
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:29.120
-The one that's a good writer?
-No, I said he's entertaining.

769
00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:29.790
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

770
00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.520
Hello? What's going on?

771
00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:44.870
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-A Cadillac has a bomb in it.

772
00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:45.910
Is it a black Escalade?
It's tied to a double homicide.

773
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:47.440
-Is the guy trying to kill himself?
-I don't think he was involved.

774
00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.770
No, you're not going
anywhere near the place.

775
00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.290
Help! Help!

776
00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.180
-Take it easy.
-Please help me!

777
00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:59.340
-Help me! Get me out!
-Calm down.

778
00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:01.880
-Help me!
-The windshield is wired in.

779
00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:02.870
The side windows are
connected to the electrical system.

780
00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:04.300
The glass seems OK,
but there are wires everywhere.

781
00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:06.940
We've got his contact details.

782
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.230
-What's going on?
-My mobile!

783
00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:13.470
-Yes?
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

784
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:14.880
I need to know whether you were
on the bridge last night.

785
00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:15.980
-What?
-Were you on the Öresund Bridge?

786
00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.090
I was working.
I was here all the time.

787
00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.460
-How will you get me out?
-I don't know, that's not my job.

788
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.570
-Do you know Kerstin Ekwall?
-Who?

789
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:20.500
Daniel? Did you do anything
apart from turn the key?

790
00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:21.880
No. Everything locked.
The countdown started.

791
00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.710
-Hello?
-I'm talking to the bomb guy.

792
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:23.520
Chairman of the City Council
Kerstin Ekwall.

793
00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.010
-Have you written about her?
-No, I don't know.

794
00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:26.130
-Have you been tipped off about her?
-No! What is this?

795
00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:26.830
Get me out! Please!

796
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:27.990
Does anyone else
have a key to your car?

797
00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:29.430
-No, I don't know.
-Can you reach it?

798
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:30.350
I don't want to die. Please.

799
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:31.670
-I don't want it to end like this.
-Daniel? You need to talk to me.

800
00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.250
It skipped a minute.
What the hell did you do?

801
00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.040
It was three, now it's two.
It was three.

802
00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:37.460
Come one, hurry up.

803
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.760
Where are you going?
Stay here! Please!

804
00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.950
Please! Come back!
Where are you going?

805
00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.600
You need to talk to me.
Daniel? Daniel?

806
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:46.570
Is it a big bomb?

807
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:48.670
-I think so.
-You're not religious, right?

808
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:49.380
You're an atheist?

809
00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.940
Everything will just stop. The body
won't have time to register pain.

810
00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:53.470
-Are you sure?
-Don't look at the clock. Listen.

811
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:54.910
Do you know why your car
was used to dump two bodies?

812
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:56.400
-No.
-Think about it. Focus.

813
00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.820
-Who did this to you?
-I've slagged so many people off.

814
00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.040
Daniel? Are you still there? Hello?

815
00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:09.410
It's clean.

816
00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:12.470
Sorry about the drama, it's hard
to make oneself heard today.

817
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:13.290
I assume I have your attention now.

818
00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:14.930
Our part of the world would be
wonderful if we solved our problems.

819
00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:15.800
I would like to
point out five in particular.

820
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.460
This is only a beginning. We've got
interesting times ahead of us.

821
00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.360
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-Copenhagen Police.

822
00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.090
-Do you know who she is?
-Yes.

823
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.050
Excuse me. A woman insists on
speaking to the person in charge.

824
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.590
-Is she in Sweden or Denmark?
-I don't know.

825
00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.260
She's Swedish, and the car came
from Sweden. I assume I'm in charge.

826
00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:26.790
-Saga Norén. Can I help you?
-When will you let traffic through?

827
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:27.890
-It might take up to two hours.
-I haven't got two hours!

828
00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:28.690
-Back up.
-Is someone's life in danger?

829
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:29.500
There's a heart for my husband
in Copenhagen.

830
00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:30.620
He needs a heart transplant.
Let us through.

831
00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:31.610
He'll have to wait.
I can't let anyone through.

832
00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.100
-What's happened?
-Is there no other way through?

833
00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:34.140
There ought to be
another way through.

834
00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:35.630
-No one's answering any questions.
-Let me pass, please.

835
00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.470
The Öresund Bridge to Denmark
is closed.

836
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:40.390
According to the police it will...

837
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.310
-It's Stefan Lindberg.
-Hi, it's Veronika.

838
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.730
-Sorry, did I wake you up?
-No, you didn't. How are you?

839
00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:48.960
I can't sleep.
I've got a stomach ache.

840
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.060
-I see. How are the boys?
-They're asleep.

841
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.140
They don't understand
what's about to happen.

842
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:52.460
-Can we meet up?
-Now?

843
00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:53.930
Of course.
Do you want me to come over?

844
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.770
-No. I'd rather go to your place.
-OK.

845
00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:56.750
-I can go to the office.
-I'll see you there.

846
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:00.400
Give me everything from
when the car came on to the bridge.

847
00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.670
One camera records at a time.
They're started manually.

848
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:02.570
My colleague
might have recorded something.

849
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:03.640
Hello! Stop! Stop!

850
00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.020
-Stop! Stop!
-I allowed it.

851
00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.330
-Why? This is a crime scene.
-I'm fully aware of that.

852
00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:07.120
-We've got enough bodies.
-He wasn't dying.

853
00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.180
-Are you a doctor?
-No, I'm a police officer.

854
00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:09.940
-What's your name?
-Martin Rohde.

855
00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:10.880
-Rohde?
-R, O, H, D, E.

856
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.600
-Have you got an ID?
-It was an ambulance.

857
00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.830
The Chairman
of Malmö City Council is dead.

858
00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:15.170
-What evidence was destroyed?
-Probably none.

859
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:15.720
Thank you.

860
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.010
Hello. Hi. Finally.

861
00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:24.460
I wont operate on Göran, Charlotte.
I had wine with my dinner.

862
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.350
-At what time? Are you drunk?
-No, but that doesn't matter.

863
00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:27.670
You promised to see us through this.

864
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:28.790
-Morten Krag is a very good surgeon.
-Better than you?

865
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:29.700
I'll decide
who my husband's surgeon is!

866
00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.210
-I wont forgive you if it goes wrong.
-What if I do it and it goes wrong?

867
00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:32.770
Then I'll never forgive myself.

868
00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:37.880
-We're done, you can move her.
-You can take her away.

869
00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:40.500
Bloody hell.

870
00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:45.990
The autopsy on Kerstin Ekwall
is being performed.

871
00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:46.950
-And the recordings?
-They'll deliver them tomorrow.

872
00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:47.750
-What about the press?
-They know.

873
00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:48.850
The radio said that it was a woman.
They don't know who it is.

874
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:50.170
-And the family?
-I'm on my way to see them.

875
00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:51.700
You'll wake them up, and there
are children there. Tread lightly.

876
00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.290
In what sense? Oh. There aren't
that many ways to say it.

877
00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:54.090
-Just tread lightly.
-Listen, Hans...

878
00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:54.830
She was chopped in half.

879
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:55.940
-Right above the hips.
-What the hell are you saying?

880
00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.020
She was due to attend a conference
in Copenhagen this morning.

881
00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.380
-Have you got more computers?
-No.

882
00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:00.310
Are you taking them?
The children's as well?

883
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.490
-When did you last talk to her?
-She called yesterday.

884
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:02.540
-Do you know what time it was?
-I don't know.

885
00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:03.610
Around half past six in the evening.

886
00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:04.450
-Was she threatened?
-By whom?

887
00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:05.260
I didn't say that she was,
I asked you.

888
00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.200
Not really. She was a politician,
there were some calls and emails.

889
00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.690
-Has she upset anyone lately?
-Lately...

890
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:09.930
She wanted to charge for
library loans. Some disapproved.

891
00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:10.950
-That's foolish.
-Sorry, what?

892
00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:12.590
Reading becomes a money matter.
Social differences will grow.

893
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:13.550
-Is that why she was...?
-We don't know why.

894
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:14.330
It's unlikely
that library fees caused it.

895
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:15.580
Why? Why did someone do this?

896
00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:17.270
Can you think of something personal?
Was she in debt? Did she use drugs?

897
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:18.040
Did she have an affair?

898
00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:22.450
Saga Norén.

899
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:23.520
Can't we talk on the phone?

900
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:24.990
I'll be there in twenty minutes. Bye.

901
00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:36.910
August?

902
00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:50.750
-Were you on the bridge?
-Yes.

903
00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:51.810
-What happened?
-A murder, the Swedes will handle it.

904
00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:52.660
-Did you check on August?
-Yes.

905
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.580
-Is he asleep?
-Yes.

906
00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:54.690
You promised to talk to him.
He's become a night owl.

907
00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:55.500
Do you want me to
wake him up now?

908
00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:57.130
-He got up at three o'clock today.
-I'll have a word with him tomorrow.

909
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.250
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

910
00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.490
-Do you know the cause of death?
-I can make a qualified guess.

911
00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:09.470
She died six to eight hours ago.

912
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:10.760
Yes, she called home at six thirty
and was dumped just after midnight.

913
00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:11.980
There's something else.

914
00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:12.660
-What?
-Take a look.

915
00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.440
No livor mortis on the ears.
That's consistent with the bleeding.

916
00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.190
Petechiae on the conjunctivas.

917
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:23.570
The face is swollen.

918
00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:25.650
She was strangled
and cut in half after death.

919
00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:26.450
And the other half?

920
00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.070
The lower body is much paler.
A lot paler.

921
00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:30.930
It's not coherent with the bleeding
or how the body was placed.

922
00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:33.150
There's brown discoloration.
Frostbite?

923
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:34.570
It feels different. Frostbite.

924
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:35.330
Not frostbite, deep-freezing.

925
00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:36.560
For about a year, I think.
I've never seen anything like this.

926
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.850
I don't know who they belong to.
They're not Kerstin Ekwall's legs.

927
00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:44.430
-So everyone's here, then.
-Yes.

928
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.970
Hi, Sebastian.

929
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:46.790
I don't know what to do.

930
00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:47.870
I'm worried about tomorrow.
I had to see you.

931
00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:48.680
Can't you just pay the rent?

932
00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.160
They can't evict the children.
Can they? Their friends are there.

933
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.000
I paid out money for the rent.

934
00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:52.550
-Why did you bring the children?
-Sören wasn't there.

935
00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:53.560
I can't manage.

936
00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:54.970
-Can't you make an exception?
-No. You know I can't.

937
00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:55.980
-Please.
-There are guidelines. I'm sorry.

938
00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:01.430
Charlotte Söringer? I'm Frederik
Henriksen, hospital administrator.

939
00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:03.310
-Göran had atrial fibrillation.
-They managed to stop it.

940
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:04.390
-He's to weak for surgery.
-Too weak?

941
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:05.610
-But there's a new heart.
-It will be given to someone else.

942
00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:06.950
Anders said
that you need a new CT scanner.

943
00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:08.570
My husband's business is doing well.
He's willing to donate a CT scanner.

944
00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:09.380
We're cancelling for his own sake.

945
00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:10.740
He'll die without a new heart.
I want both parties to benefit.

946
00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.420
Pass my offer on
to the proper authority, please.

947
00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:18.760
-Hello? Is this Martin Rohde?
-Yes.

948
00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:19.930
-It's Saga Norén from the bridge.
-Yes, I remember.

949
00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:21.620
-Were you asleep?
-I tend to doze off around this time.

950
00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:22.510
-There were two women.
-You found another one.

951
00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:23.480
The lower body
belonged to someone else.

952
00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.780
-Have you found half a body?
-I don't know.

953
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.310
It could be more than a year ago.
The legs have been deep-frozen.

954
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:27.510
-Can you look into it? Now?
-First thing tomorrow morning.

955
00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:28.730
Can someone else
look into it straight away?

956
00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:30.460
-I'll call you back.
-When?

957
00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:32.990
-Do you have to get up?
-Yes.

958
00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:40.990
Missing woman, Caucasian,
at least a year ago...

959
00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:41.690
-How old?
-Adult.

960
00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:42.730
-And life in general is OK?
-Yes.

961
00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:43.450
-What about you?
-I'm fine.

962
00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:45.270
-So you'll be firing blanks.
-Was it in the staff news bulletin?

963
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.710
-Is everything working as it should?
-It will in time.

964
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:47.390
It can't be much fun.

965
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:48.620
-What do you mean?
-You've heard about castrated toms?

966
00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.320
A wild predator turns into
a chunky sleepyhead. Just like that.

967
00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:52.210
They're castrated,
that's not the same thing.

968
00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:53.380
Let's see what we've got.

969
00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:54.680
Two women killed a year apart.

970
00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.930
One was deep-frozen.
They were dismembered.

971
00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:57.590
And assembled on the bridge.
Someone wants to make a statement.

972
00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.360
-Saga Norén.
-It's Martin.

973
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.860
The lower body is Monique Brammer,
I think. A missing 23-year-old.

974
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:02.670
-Can you email the info?
-I'll be right over.

975
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:03.690
-Why do you want to come here?
-She's Danish.

976
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:04.900
I was first on the scene.
Everyone's still asleep here.

977
00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:05.770
-Do you mind if I come over?
-Yes.

978
00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:06.930
Make sure I'm allowed in.
You've got my details.

979
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:08.810
Martin Rohde has probably identified
the second body. He's coming over.

980
00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:09.980
-Is that a problem?
-Yes...

981
00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:10.850
No, no.

982
00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:12.340
If half of the body is Danish,
we have to cooperate.

983
00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:13.110
I'll schedule a meeting
at half past five.

984
00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:14.110
-Can you be ready by then?
-Yes.

985
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:21.690
It finally worked out.

986
00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:25.180
-What did you just sign?
-Formalities.

987
00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:26.840
-Whose is it?
-What?

988
00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.470
The heart. Whose is it?

989
00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:28.560
A man's. He's 25 or 26
and had a motorcycle accident.

990
00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:30.780
-What's his name?
-I don't know. Does it matter?

991
00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:32.450
No, I guess it doesn't.

992
00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:34.760
-I'm scared.
-It will be fine.

993
00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:36.540
Anders will operate, they're all
highly skilled. It will be fine.

994
00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:37.470
I can't imagine life without you.

995
00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:39.970
-I need to take Göran with me.
-Don't worry. You'll make it, honey.

996
00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:41.730
-Hi.
-Hi.

997
00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:42.570
-Hi! An early breakfast?
-No thank you.

998
00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:43.980
-An email would have been faster.
-Yes, but not as pleasant.

999
00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:45.740
-Where are you going?
-I'm coming in with you.

1000
00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.970
If it really is Monique Brammer,
we both have responsibilities.

1001
00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:49.690
Go straight on,
turn left, and register.

1002
00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:53.940
-Good morning. Coffee?
-No thanks, I've already had some.

1003
00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.310
I'm Martin Rohde.
I'll be working with Saga.

1004
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:56.880
-Thank you. You need to register.
-I also need a card.

1005
00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:57.670
-My name's Felicia.
-Nice to meet you.

1006
00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:59.030
-That's it. This is for you.
-Thank you.

1007
00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:00.330
-And one of these is for you.
-Thanks! Ooh, Danish.

1008
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.990
-See you later.
-I hope so.

1009
00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.850
-Where's Saga Norén?
-To the right. Bye!

1010
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.730
Excuse me.

1011
00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:10.580
-Sit down.
-I'm afraid I can't.

1012
00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:13.100
-You make me nervous.
-OK, I can stand still.

1013
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.420
-Why can't you sit down?
-My nether regions hurt.

1014
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:16.220
-I had a vasectomy yesterday.
-Right.

1015
00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:17.090
I've got five children
with three different women.

1016
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.440
-Have you got children?
-No, why would I want to?

1017
00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.550
-I've never heard anyone ask that.
-Many should have.

1018
00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:21.730
Not you,
I'm sure you're a wonderful dad.

1019
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:25.410
-Why aren't you off sick?
-I can't afford it. August moved in.

1020
00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:27.200
Well, it's not really about money.
It was a small procedure, I can work.

1021
00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.100
-You can't sit down.
-I can.

1022
00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:29.210
-I drove here.
-Pretend that the chair is a car.

1023
00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:31.460
Yes.

1024
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.070
-No one wanted to solve the case.
-What do you mean?

1025
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.950
Monique Brammer
was reported missing.

1026
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:37.480
Two prostitutes and a neighbour were
interviewed. The case was shelved.

1027
00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.380
It fell between two stools.

1028
00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.660
She disappeared, or she was killed.
They didn't find a body.

1029
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:40.810
The case was
supposed to be shelved.

1030
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:42.030
I'm surprised it took two weeks.
Come with me.

1031
00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:46.430
Do you think I should?
I tried painkillers, but...

1032
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:48.000
-Two computers?
-They know who it is now.

1033
00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:48.800
-Will Saga handle the case, Hans?
-Yes.

1034
00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:49.730
-That's good.
-And a Danish police officer.

1035
00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:51.520
-Does he know that she's a bit odd?
-If not, he'll soon find out.

1036
00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:53.880
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

1037
00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.130
-This is Martin Röhde.
-It's Rohde.

1038
00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:56.430
Not as when you say "fur".
Rohde, Foure...

1039
00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.420
-Have you read the file?
-Most people have just arrived.

1040
00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:59.490
Half of two female bodies were found.
One was Kerstin Ekwall.

1041
00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:00.270
The other one has been deep-frozen.
Martin?

1042
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:01.630
It's probably the 23-year-old
Monique Brammer from Copenhagen.

1043
00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:02.850
A prostitute and an addict
that went missing 13 months ago.

1044
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:04.490
Do you want me to repeat that?
A bit slower?

1045
00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.640
Monique Brammer, 23 years old.
A prostitute and an addict.

1046
00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.540
She went missing 13 months ago.

1047
00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.110
-Right.
-The investigation was inadequate.

1048
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:10.430
-Don't you agree?
-Yes. It was terrible.

1049
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:11.540
But we found blood traces
in her apartment.

1050
00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.930
The samples are on their way
and can be compared to the body.

1051
00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:14.160
Before the bodies were dumped,
the power was cut for 48 seconds.

1052
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.180
Their trying to trace the signal.
Can you help them, Gry?

1053
00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:16.200
-How was it done?
-Someone accessed a computer.

1054
00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:16.680
Can you show me the fourth picture?

1055
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.720
Use all the people you need. Gry?

1056
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.100
Here's Ekwall's mobile number.
Get the phone records.

1057
00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:20.240
Check her computers.
Talk to John about passwords.

1058
00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.150
Anne?
Find out where she was abducted.

1059
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:22.380
She left work half past six.
She had a car. Find it!

1060
00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:23.820
-Were they dumped from her car?
-No, a black Cadillac Escalade.

1061
00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.280
The image where the bridge
is seen from above.

1062
00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:26.640
-John can find the license number.
-What? Sure.

1063
00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:27.630
-What are you doing?
-I had an idea.

1064
00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:29.160
The orange line the body was on...
We discussed where she was.

1065
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.010
Here's the Swedish-Danish border.

1066
00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:31.110
One half is in Sweden,
one is in Denmark.

1067
00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:32.220
-It's millimetre perfect.
-Tell me everything about the line.

1068
00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:32.850
Take paint samples.

1069
00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:34.420
Power cut, body halves, a politician.
We'll be in the public eye.

1070
00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:44.430
-Hi. Is Veronika at home?
-Yes.

1071
00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:45.320
-What do you want?
-I would like to talk to her.

1072
00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.560
-You can talk to me.
-I would if you were clean.

1073
00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:47.740
-What? I am clean.
-Hi, Veronika.

1074
00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.220
-Isn't it enough to have us evicted?
-The landlord did that.

1075
00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:51.130
-You're not helping.
-I'm trying. I'm trying really hard.

1076
00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:52.630
If you had been more dependable,
you wouldn't have to move.

1077
00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:55.060
-That was bloody stupid.
-Sören! Stop it!

1078
00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:57.660
What the hell?

1079
00:33:59.210 --> 00:33:59.940
Stop, you bastard!

1080
00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:02.450
Stop! Come out!

1081
00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:06.110
Sören! Stop it, Sören! Stop it!

1082
00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:07.030
-I hate that bloody bastard!
-Sören!

1083
00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:08.770
He's caused trouble all along.
It makes me so angry!

1084
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:10.280
Let go of me.
Go to hell, you bloody idiots.

1085
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.840
-How's the operation going?
-It hasn't started.

1086
00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:21.970
-Why? He was prepared hours ago.
-I don't know.

1087
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.700
I'm afraid I have to go.

1088
00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:24.230
-Don't you know where he is?
-You probably know better than me.

1089
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:25.670
We'll call you if we hear from him...
Let's go.

1090
00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:27.400
-I'm sorry about all of this.
-Stop apologizing for him.

1091
00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:29.300
He's an adult
and makes his own decisions.

1092
00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:30.930
Maybe you should do the same?
Sören put you in this position.

1093
00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:32.510
You spend your money wisely,
but can't if you're not given any.

1094
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:33.920
You don't get the chance
to care for your boys.

1095
00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.490
-He hits you and the children.
-Hardly ever the children.

1096
00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:36.520
Hardly ever? That's not good enough.

1097
00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.610
He shouldn't hit any of you.

1098
00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.560
You can get your life back on track.
Just you and the children.

1099
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:41.600
Leave your husband
or nothing will change.

1100
00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:42.930
Think about it.

1101
00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.620
-Anders? What's going on?
-We've got a problem.

1102
00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:49.090
The donor was declared brain dead,
and a nurse spoke to his father.

1103
00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:50.450
The father changed his mind.
We can't have the heart. Göran!

1104
00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.350
Wasn't that the turn-off?

1105
00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.060
-Stefan? Wasn't that the turn-off?
-No, not today.

1106
00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.710
-Where are we going?
-You'll see.

1107
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.580
Johan was nicknamed "The old bag".
He died a month ago.

1108
00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:11.450
No wife, no children, no debts,
no assets. The house was all he had.

1109
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:12.460
It went to the local council.

1110
00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:15.710
It's Sören.

1111
00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:17.640
Come.

1112
00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:26.820
-Step inside.
-What about the children?

1113
00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:27.540
They can stay outside a while longer.

1114
00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:30.430
-Where are we? Why are we here?
-Just go inside.

1115
00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.790
-Crime scene and meeting place.
-Have you worked here a long time?

1116
00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:35.380
-More than ten years?
-Yes.

1117
00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:36.500
-Are you from around here?
-From Malmö? No.

1118
00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:38.260
I'm from Copenhagen.
I was born there.

1119
00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:40.740
No wonder Ingmar Bergman
and Lars Norén are from Sweden.

1120
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:42.010
-Are you related to Lars Norén?
-No.

1121
00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:43.250
We need to find the meeting place
and the crime scene.

1122
00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:44.470
Where did the perpetrator
meet the victim?

1123
00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:49.130
I've spoken to Copenhagen.
You'll cooperate on the deaths.

1124
00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:50.170
Here's info about your authority.

1125
00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:51.370
I know what applies to me
in Denmark.

1126
00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:52.760
-Can I have a word with you, Saga?
-Yes.

1127
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:55.150
The report you filed
against Martin...

1128
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.820
Yes, there's only one.

1129
00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:56.830
What do you suggest I do with it?

1130
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:57.830
Don't you think
it will affect your cooperation?

1131
00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:58.940
-Do you think so?
-I think there's every chance.

1132
00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:00.240
-Will he dislike me?
-That might happen.

1133
00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.800
Because of my report?
It doesn't have to affect the case.

1134
00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:02.840
He let an ambulance through.
No life was in danger.

1135
00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:03.850
-I'm supposed to file a report.
-I'll handle the report.

1136
00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:05.510
-Yes, that's fine. Fine.
-I've got the car's license number.

1137
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:06.360
It belongs to Daniel Farbé in Malmö.

1138
00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.270
-The journalist?
-Yes, he's a journalist.

1139
00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.500
-Do you know who he is?
-Yes. I read his column.

1140
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:11.790
It's entertaining.

1141
00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:26.690
-You made me jump.
-I worked all night.

1142
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:27.920
-I'm done for the week. Berlin next.
-You work all night.

1143
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:28.820
Then you get down in Berlin.
How do you manage?

1144
00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:29.990
Get down?
How many children have you got?

1145
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:30.910
Children that suck the life
out of you.

1146
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:32.600
I haven't got children. No one says
"get down" any more. No one.

1147
00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:33.890
-Have fun.
-I will.

1148
00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:34.600
I downloaded
"Elephants in the Desert".

1149
00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:35.670
What do you want, Åke?

1150
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:36.770
A hug, an award, an applause?
Would you like one?

1151
00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.510
-They're really cool. I like them.
-Yes, they were cool.

1152
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.940
What?
Two weeks ago you really liked them.

1153
00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:40.530
And now you like them.

1154
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:41.600
My daughter...

1155
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:43.720
-She danced all afternoon.
-Sorry, I have to answer.

1156
00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:45.100
We'll have to continue this later.

1157
00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:47.820
You and the boys will disappear.

1158
00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:48.720
Your paperwork
and your debts are gone.

1159
00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:50.460
You can make a fresh start.
Do you understand?

1160
00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.650
You can make a fresh start.
There's cash and a mobile here.

1161
00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.330
But you can never see or talk to
your husband again.

1162
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:55.930
He's their dad.
I have to let them see him.

1163
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:57.010
Why? Why do they have to?

1164
00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.250
To get another beating?
To be scared and broke?

1165
00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:00.810
Let him spend everything on drugs?
He'll ruin everything for you again.

1166
00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:01.870
People like him ruin things.

1167
00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:03.540
You don't know me.
Why are you doing this?

1168
00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:06.600
Because I can.

1169
00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:18.560
Bloody hell.

1170
00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:27.630
-Here's my car.
-Do you think it's him?

1171
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:28.890
He kept a body in a freezer
and killed a politician.

1172
00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:29.980
-He wouldn't use his own car.
-Nice car.

1173
00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.280
-Is the Swedish police paid well?
-No, the same as in Denmark.

1174
00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.710
Don't jump to conclusions
about my wages based on my car.

1175
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:34.000
Maybe it was a gift?
Maybe I inherited it or had savings?

1176
00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.270
I hope your professional conclusions
are more valid.

1177
00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:36.560
Read this.
It's Daniel Ferbé's latest column.

1178
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.850
-The one that's a good writer?
-No, I said he's entertaining.

1179
00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:38.520
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

1180
00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:52.250
Hello? What's going on?

1181
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:53.600
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-A Cadillac has a bomb in it.

1182
00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:54.640
Is it a black Escalade?
It's tied to a double homicide.

1183
00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.170
-Is the guy trying to kill himself?
-I don't think he was involved.

1184
00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:57.500
No, you're not going
anywhere near the place.

1185
00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:06.020
Help! Help!

1186
00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:06.910
-Take it easy.
-Please help me!

1187
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:08.070
-Help me! Get me out!
-Calm down.

1188
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:10.610
-Help me!
-The windshield is wired in.

1189
00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:11.600
The side windows are
connected to the electrical system.

1190
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.030
The glass seems OK,
but there are wires everywhere.

1191
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:15.670
We've got his contact details.

1192
00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:20.960
-What's going on?
-My mobile!

1193
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.200
-Yes?
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

1194
00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.610
I need to know whether you were
on the bridge last night.

1195
00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:24.710
-What?
-Were you on the Öresund Bridge?

1196
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:25.820
I was working.
I was here all the time.

1197
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:27.190
-How will you get me out?
-I don't know, that's not my job.

1198
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:28.300
-Do you know Kerstin Ekwall?
-Who?

1199
00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:29.230
Daniel? Did you do anything
apart from turn the key?

1200
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:30.610
No. Everything locked.
The countdown started.

1201
00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:31.440
-Hello?
-I'm talking to the bomb guy.

1202
00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.250
Chairman of the City Council
Kerstin Ekwall.

1203
00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:33.740
-Have you written about her?
-No, I don't know.

1204
00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:34.860
-Have you been tipped off about her?
-No! What is this?

1205
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:35.560
Get me out! Please!

1206
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.720
Does anyone else
have a key to your car?

1207
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.160
-No, I don't know.
-Can you reach it?

1208
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.080
I don't want to die. Please.

1209
00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.400
-I don't want it to end like this.
-Daniel? You need to talk to me.

1210
00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:42.980
It skipped a minute.
What the hell did you do?

1211
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:44.770
It was three, now it's two.
It was three.

1212
00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:46.190
Come one, hurry up.

1213
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:47.490
Where are you going?
Stay here! Please!

1214
00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:49.680
Please! Come back!
Where are you going?

1215
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:54.330
You need to talk to me.
Daniel? Daniel?

1216
00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:55.300
Is it a big bomb?

1217
00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.400
-I think so.
-You're not religious, right?

1218
00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.110
You're an atheist?

1219
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:59.670
Everything will just stop. The body
won't have time to register pain.

1220
00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.200
-Are you sure?
-Don't look at the clock. Listen.

1221
00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.640
Do you know why your car
was used to dump two bodies?

1222
00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.130
-No.
-Think about it. Focus.

1223
00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:06.550
-Who did this to you?
-I've slagged so many people off.

1224
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:10.770
Daniel? Are you still there? Hello?

1225
00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:18.140
It's clean.

1226
00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.200
Sorry about the drama, it's hard
to make oneself heard today.

1227
00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:22.020
I assume I have your attention now.

1228
00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.660
Our part of the world would be
wonderful if we solved our problems.

1229
00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:24.530
I would like to
point out five in particular.

1230
00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:26.190
This is only a beginning. We've got
interesting times ahead of us.

1231
00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:27.090
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-Copenhagen Police.

1232
00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:27.820
-Do you know who she is?
-Yes.

1233
00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:29.780
Excuse me. A woman insists on
speaking to the person in charge.

1234
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:31.320
-Is she in Sweden or Denmark?
-I don't know.

1235
00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:32.990
She's Swedish, and the car came
from Sweden. I assume I'm in charge.

1236
00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.520
-Saga Norén. Can I help you?
-When will you let traffic through?

1237
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:36.620
-It might take up to two hours.
-I haven't got two hours!

1238
00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:37.420
-Back up.
-Is someone's life in danger?

1239
00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:38.230
There's a heart for my husband
in Copenhagen.

1240
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:39.350
He needs a heart transplant.
Let us through.

1241
00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:40.340
He'll have to wait.
I can't let anyone through.

1242
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:41.830
-What's happened?
-Is there no other way through?

1243
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:42.870
There ought to be
another way through.

1244
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:44.360
-No one's answering any questions.
-Let me pass, please.

1245
00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:48.200
The Öresund Bridge to Denmark
is closed.

1246
00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.120
According to the police it will...

1247
00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.040
-It's Stefan Lindberg.
-Hi, it's Veronika.

1248
00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.460
-Sorry, did I wake you up?
-No, you didn't. How are you?

1249
00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.690
I can't sleep.
I've got a stomach ache.

1250
00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:58.790
-I see. How are the boys?
-They're asleep.

1251
00:39:58.830 --> 00:39:59.870
They don't understand
what's about to happen.

1252
00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:01.190
-Can we meet up?
-Now?

1253
00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:02.660
Of course.
Do you want me to come over?

1254
00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:04.500
-No. I'd rather go to your place.
-OK.

1255
00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:05.480
-I can go to the office.
-I'll see you there.

1256
00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:09.130
Give me everything from
when the car came on to the bridge.

1257
00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:10.400
One camera records at a time.
They're started manually.

1258
00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.300
My colleague
might have recorded something.

1259
00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:12.370
Hello! Stop! Stop!

1260
00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:13.750
-Stop! Stop!
-I allowed it.

1261
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:15.060
-Why? This is a crime scene.
-I'm fully aware of that.

1262
00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:15.850
-We've got enough bodies.
-He wasn't dying.

1263
00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:16.910
-Are you a doctor?
-No, I'm a police officer.

1264
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:18.670
-What's your name?
-Martin Rohde.

1265
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:19.610
-Rohde?
-R, O, H, D, E.

1266
00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.330
-Have you got an ID?
-It was an ambulance.

1267
00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:22.560
The Chairman
of Malmö City Council is dead.

1268
00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.900
-What evidence was destroyed?
-Probably none.

1269
00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:24.450
Thank you.

1270
00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:31.740
Hello. Hi. Finally.

1271
00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:33.190
I wont operate on Göran, Charlotte.
I had wine with my dinner.

1272
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:35.080
-At what time? Are you drunk?
-No, but that doesn't matter.

1273
00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:36.400
You promised to see us through this.

1274
00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.520
-Morten Krag is a very good surgeon.
-Better than you?

1275
00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:38.430
I'll decide
who my husband's surgeon is!

1276
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:39.940
-I wont forgive you if it goes wrong.
-What if I do it and it goes wrong?

1277
00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:41.500
Then I'll never forgive myself.

1278
00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.610
-We're done, you can move her.
-You can take her away.

1279
00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:49.230
Bloody hell.

1280
00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:54.720
The autopsy on Kerstin Ekwall
is being performed.

1281
00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:55.680
-And the recordings?
-They'll deliver them tomorrow.

1282
00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:56.480
-What about the press?
-They know.

1283
00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.580
The radio said that it was a woman.
They don't know who it is.

1284
00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:58.900
-And the family?
-I'm on my way to see them.

1285
00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:00.430
You'll wake them up, and there
are children there. Tread lightly.

1286
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:02.020
In what sense? Oh. There aren't
that many ways to say it.

1287
00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:02.820
-Just tread lightly.
-Listen, Hans...

1288
00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:03.560
She was chopped in half.

1289
00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.670
-Right above the hips.
-What the hell are you saying?

1290
00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:06.750
She was due to attend a conference
in Copenhagen this morning.

1291
00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:08.110
-Have you got more computers?
-No.

1292
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:09.040
Are you taking them?
The children's as well?

1293
00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.220
-When did you last talk to her?
-She called yesterday.

1294
00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.270
-Do you know what time it was?
-I don't know.

1295
00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:12.340
Around half past six in the evening.

1296
00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:13.180
-Was she threatened?
-By whom?

1297
00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:13.990
I didn't say that she was,
I asked you.

1298
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:15.930
Not really. She was a politician,
there were some calls and emails.

1299
00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:17.420
-Has she upset anyone lately?
-Lately...

1300
00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:18.660
She wanted to charge for
library loans. Some disapproved.

1301
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:19.680
-That's foolish.
-Sorry, what?

1302
00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.320
Reading becomes a money matter.
Social differences will grow.

1303
00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.280
-Is that why she was...?
-We don't know why.

1304
00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.060
It's unlikely
that library fees caused it.

1305
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:24.310
Why? Why did someone do this?

1306
00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:26.000
Can you think of something personal?
Was she in debt? Did she use drugs?

1307
00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:26.770
Did she have an affair?

1308
00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:31.180
Saga Norén.

1309
00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:32.250
Can't we talk on the phone?

1310
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:33.720
I'll be there in twenty minutes. Bye.

1311
00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:45.640
August?

1312
00:41:58.690 --> 00:41:59.480
-Were you on the bridge?
-Yes.

1313
00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:00.540
-What happened?
-A murder, the Swedes will handle it.

1314
00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:01.390
-Did you check on August?
-Yes.

1315
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:02.310
-Is he asleep?
-Yes.

1316
00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:03.420
You promised to talk to him.
He's become a night owl.

1317
00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:04.230
Do you want me to
wake him up now?

1318
00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:05.860
-He got up at three o'clock today.
-I'll have a word with him tomorrow.

1319
00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:09.980
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

1320
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:17.220
-Do you know the cause of death?
-I can make a qualified guess.

1321
00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:18.200
She died six to eight hours ago.

1322
00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.490
Yes, she called home at six thirty
and was dumped just after midnight.

1323
00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:20.710
There's something else.

1324
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:21.390
-What?
-Take a look.

1325
00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:30.170
No livor mortis on the ears.
That's consistent with the bleeding.

1326
00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:30.920
Petechiae on the conjunctivas.

1327
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:32.300
The face is swollen.

1328
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:34.380
She was strangled
and cut in half after death.

1329
00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:35.180
And the other half?

1330
00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:37.800
The lower body is much paler.
A lot paler.

1331
00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:39.660
It's not coherent with the bleeding
or how the body was placed.

1332
00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:41.880
There's brown discoloration.
Frostbite?

1333
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:43.300
It feels different. Frostbite.

1334
00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.060
Not frostbite, deep-freezing.

1335
00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.290
For about a year, I think.
I've never seen anything like this.

1336
00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:46.580
I don't know who they belong to.
They're not Kerstin Ekwall's legs.

1337
00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:53.160
-So everyone's here, then.
-Yes.

1338
00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:53.700
Hi, Sebastian.

1339
00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:55.520
I don't know what to do.

1340
00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:56.600
I'm worried about tomorrow.
I had to see you.

1341
00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:57.410
Can't you just pay the rent?

1342
00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:58.890
They can't evict the children.
Can they? Their friends are there.

1343
00:42:58.930 --> 00:42:59.730
I paid out money for the rent.

1344
00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:01.280
-Why did you bring the children?
-Sören wasn't there.

1345
00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:02.290
I can't manage.

1346
00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:03.700
-Can't you make an exception?
-No. You know I can't.

1347
00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:04.710
-Please.
-There are guidelines. I'm sorry.

1348
00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.160
Charlotte Söringer? I'm Frederik
Henriksen, hospital administrator.

1349
00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:12.040
-Göran had atrial fibrillation.
-They managed to stop it.

1350
00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.120
-He's to weak for surgery.
-Too weak?

1351
00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.340
-But there's a new heart.
-It will be given to someone else.

1352
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:15.680
Anders said
that you need a new CT scanner.

1353
00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.300
My husband's business is doing well.
He's willing to donate a CT scanner.

1354
00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:18.110
We're cancelling for his own sake.

1355
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:19.470
He'll die without a new heart.
I want both parties to benefit.

1356
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:21.150
Pass my offer on
to the proper authority, please.

1357
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:27.490
-Hello? Is this Martin Rohde?
-Yes.

1358
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:28.660
-It's Saga Norén from the bridge.
-Yes, I remember.

1359
00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.350
-Were you asleep?
-I tend to doze off around this time.

1360
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:31.240
-There were two women.
-You found another one.

1361
00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.210
The lower body
belonged to someone else.

1362
00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:33.510
-Have you found half a body?
-I don't know.

1363
00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:35.040
It could be more than a year ago.
The legs have been deep-frozen.

1364
00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.240
-Can you look into it? Now?
-First thing tomorrow morning.

1365
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:37.460
Can someone else
look into it straight away?

1366
00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:39.190
-I'll call you back.
-When?

1367
00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:41.720
-Do you have to get up?
-Yes.

1368
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:49.720
Missing woman, Caucasian,
at least a year ago...

1369
00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:50.420
-How old?
-Adult.

1370
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:51.460
-And life in general is OK?
-Yes.

1371
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:52.180
-What about you?
-I'm fine.

1372
00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:54.000
-So you'll be firing blanks.
-Was it in the staff news bulletin?

1373
00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.440
-Is everything working as it should?
-It will in time.

1374
00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:56.120
It can't be much fun.

1375
00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.350
-What do you mean?
-You've heard about castrated toms?

1376
00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:59.050
A wild predator turns into
a chunky sleepyhead. Just like that.

1377
00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:00.940
They're castrated,
that's not the same thing.

1378
00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:02.110
Let's see what we've got.

1379
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:03.410
Two women killed a year apart.

1380
00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:04.660
One was deep-frozen.
They were dismembered.

1381
00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:06.320
And assembled on the bridge.
Someone wants to make a statement.

1382
00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:09.090
-Saga Norén.
-It's Martin.

1383
00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:10.590
The lower body is Monique Brammer,
I think. A missing 23-year-old.

1384
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:11.400
-Can you email the info?
-I'll be right over.

1385
00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.420
-Why do you want to come here?
-She's Danish.

1386
00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:13.630
I was first on the scene.
Everyone's still asleep here.

1387
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:14.500
-Do you mind if I come over?
-Yes.

1388
00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:15.660
Make sure I'm allowed in.
You've got my details.

1389
00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:17.540
Martin Rohde has probably identified
the second body. He's coming over.

1390
00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:18.710
-Is that a problem?
-Yes...

1391
00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:19.580
No, no.

1392
00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:21.070
If half of the body is Danish,
we have to cooperate.

1393
00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:21.840
I'll schedule a meeting
at half past five.

1394
00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:22.840
-Can you be ready by then?
-Yes.

1395
00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:30.420
It finally worked out.

1396
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:33.910
-What did you just sign?
-Formalities.

1397
00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:35.570
-Whose is it?
-What?

1398
00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:36.200
The heart. Whose is it?

1399
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.290
A man's. He's 25 or 26
and had a motorcycle accident.

1400
00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:39.510
-What's his name?
-I don't know. Does it matter?

1401
00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:41.180
No, I guess it doesn't.

1402
00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:43.490
-I'm scared.
-It will be fine.

1403
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:45.270
Anders will operate, they're all
highly skilled. It will be fine.

1404
00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:46.200
I can't imagine life without you.

1405
00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:48.700
-I need to take Göran with me.
-Don't worry. You'll make it, honey.

1406
00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:50.460
-Hi.
-Hi.

1407
00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:51.300
-Hi! An early breakfast?
-No thank you.

1408
00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:52.710
-An email would have been faster.
-Yes, but not as pleasant.

1409
00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:54.470
-Where are you going?
-I'm coming in with you.

1410
00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:56.700
If it really is Monique Brammer,
we both have responsibilities.

1411
00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:58.420
Go straight on,
turn left, and register.

1412
00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:02.670
-Good morning. Coffee?
-No thanks, I've already had some.

1413
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:04.040
I'm Martin Rohde.
I'll be working with Saga.

1414
00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.610
-Thank you. You need to register.
-I also need a card.

1415
00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:06.400
-My name's Felicia.
-Nice to meet you.

1416
00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:07.760
-That's it. This is for you.
-Thank you.

1417
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.060
-And one of these is for you.
-Thanks! Ooh, Danish.

1418
00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:10.720
-See you later.
-I hope so.

1419
00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:14.580
-Where's Saga Norén?
-To the right. Bye!

1420
00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:18.460
Excuse me.

1421
00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:19.310
-Sit down.
-I'm afraid I can't.

1422
00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:21.830
-You make me nervous.
-OK, I can stand still.

1423
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:23.150
-Why can't you sit down?
-My nether regions hurt.

1424
00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:24.950
-I had a vasectomy yesterday.
-Right.

1425
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:25.820
I've got five children
with three different women.

1426
00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:27.170
-Have you got children?
-No, why would I want to?

1427
00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:28.280
-I've never heard anyone ask that.
-Many should have.

1428
00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:30.460
Not you,
I'm sure you're a wonderful dad.

1429
00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:34.140
-Why aren't you off sick?
-I can't afford it. August moved in.

1430
00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:35.930
Well, it's not really about money.
It was a small procedure, I can work.

1431
00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:36.830
-You can't sit down.
-I can.

1432
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:37.940
-I drove here.
-Pretend that the chair is a car.

1433
00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:40.190
Yes.

1434
00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:43.800
-No one wanted to solve the case.
-What do you mean?

1435
00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:44.680
Monique Brammer
was reported missing.

1436
00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.210
Two prostitutes and a neighbour were
interviewed. The case was shelved.

1437
00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:47.110
It fell between two stools.

1438
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:48.390
She disappeared, or she was killed.
They didn't find a body.

1439
00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:49.540
The case was
supposed to be shelved.

1440
00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:50.760
I'm surprised it took two weeks.
Come with me.

1441
00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:55.160
Do you think I should?
I tried painkillers, but...

1442
00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:56.730
-Two computers?
-They know who it is now.

1443
00:45:56.770 --> 00:45:57.530
-Will Saga handle the case, Hans?
-Yes.

1444
00:45:57.570 --> 00:45:58.460
-That's good.
-And a Danish police officer.

1445
00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.250
-Does he know that she's a bit odd?
-If not, he'll soon find out.

1446
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:02.610
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

1447
00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:03.860
-This is Martin Röhde.
-It's Rohde.

1448
00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:05.160
Not as when you say "fur".
Rohde, Foure...

1449
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:07.150
-Have you read the file?
-Most people have just arrived.

1450
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:08.220
Half of two female bodies were found.
One was Kerstin Ekwall.

1451
00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:09.000
The other one has been deep-frozen.
Martin?

1452
00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.360
It's probably the 23-year-old
Monique Brammer from Copenhagen.

1453
00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:11.580
A prostitute and an addict
that went missing 13 months ago.

1454
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:13.220
Do you want me to repeat that?
A bit slower?

1455
00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:14.370
Monique Brammer, 23 years old.
A prostitute and an addict.

1456
00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:15.270
She went missing 13 months ago.

1457
00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:16.840
-Right.
-The investigation was inadequate.

1458
00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:19.160
-Don't you agree?
-Yes. It was terrible.

1459
00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:20.270
But we found blood traces
in her apartment.

1460
00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:21.660
The samples are on their way
and can be compared to the body.

1461
00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:22.890
Before the bodies were dumped,
the power was cut for 48 seconds.

1462
00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:23.910
Their trying to trace the signal.
Can you help them, Gry?

1463
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:24.930
-How was it done?
-Someone accessed a computer.

1464
00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:25.410
Can you show me the fourth picture?

1465
00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:26.450
Use all the people you need. Gry?

1466
00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:27.830
Here's Ekwall's mobile number.
Get the phone records.

1467
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:28.970
Check her computers.
Talk to John about passwords.

1468
00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:29.880
Anne?
Find out where she was abducted.

1469
00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.110
She left work half past six.
She had a car. Find it!

1470
00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:32.550
-Were they dumped from her car?
-No, a black Cadillac Escalade.

1471
00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:34.010
The image where the bridge
is seen from above.

1472
00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:35.370
-John can find the license number.
-What? Sure.

1473
00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:36.360
-What are you doing?
-I had an idea.

1474
00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.890
The orange line the body was on...
We discussed where she was.

1475
00:46:37.930 --> 00:46:38.740
Here's the Swedish-Danish border.

1476
00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:39.840
One half is in Sweden,
one is in Denmark.

1477
00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:40.950
-It's millimetre perfect.
-Tell me everything about the line.

1478
00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:41.580
Take paint samples.

1479
00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:43.150
Power cut, body halves, a politician.
We'll be in the public eye.

1480
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:53.160
-Hi. Is Veronika at home?
-Yes.

1481
00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.050
-What do you want?
-I would like to talk to her.

1482
00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:55.290
-You can talk to me.
-I would if you were clean.

1483
00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:56.470
-What? I am clean.
-Hi, Veronika.

1484
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:57.950
-Isn't it enough to have us evicted?
-The landlord did that.

1485
00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:59.860
-You're not helping.
-I'm trying. I'm trying really hard.

1486
00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:01.360
If you had been more dependable,
you wouldn't have to move.

1487
00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:03.790
-That was bloody stupid.
-Sören! Stop it!

1488
00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:06.390
What the hell?

1489
00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:08.670
Stop, you bastard!

1490
00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:11.180
Stop! Come out!

1491
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:14.840
Sören! Stop it, Sören! Stop it!

1492
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.760
-I hate that bloody bastard!
-Sören!

1493
00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.500
He's caused trouble all along.
It makes me so angry!

1494
00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:19.010
Let go of me.
Go to hell, you bloody idiots.

1495
00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:29.570
-How's the operation going?
-It hasn't started.

1496
00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:30.700
-Why? He was prepared hours ago.
-I don't know.

1497
00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:31.430
I'm afraid I have to go.

1498
00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:32.960
-Don't you know where he is?
-You probably know better than me.

1499
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.400
We'll call you if we hear from him...
Let's go.

1500
00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:36.130
-I'm sorry about all of this.
-Stop apologizing for him.

1501
00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:38.030
He's an adult
and makes his own decisions.

1502
00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:39.660
Maybe you should do the same?
Sören put you in this position.

1503
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:41.240
You spend your money wisely,
but can't if you're not given any.

1504
00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:42.650
You don't get the chance
to care for your boys.

1505
00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:44.220
-He hits you and the children.
-Hardly ever the children.

1506
00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:45.250
Hardly ever? That's not good enough.

1507
00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:46.340
He shouldn't hit any of you.

1508
00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:48.290
You can get your life back on track.
Just you and the children.

1509
00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:50.330
Leave your husband
or nothing will change.

1510
00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:51.660
Think about it.

1511
00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:56.350
-Anders? What's going on?
-We've got a problem.

1512
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:57.820
The donor was declared brain dead,
and a nurse spoke to his father.

1513
00:47:57.860 --> 00:47:59.180
The father changed his mind.
We can't have the heart. Göran!

1514
00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:06.080
Wasn't that the turn-off?

1515
00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:07.790
-Stefan? Wasn't that the turn-off?
-No, not today.

1516
00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:09.440
-Where are we going?
-You'll see.

1517
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:18.310
Johan was nicknamed "The old bag".
He died a month ago.

1518
00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:20.180
No wife, no children, no debts,
no assets. The house was all he had.

1519
00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.190
It went to the local council.

1520
00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:24.440
It's Sören.

1521
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:26.370
Come.

1522
00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:35.550
-Step inside.
-What about the children?

1523
00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:36.270
They can stay outside a while longer.

1524
00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:39.160
-Where are we? Why are we here?
-Just go inside.

1525
00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:43.520
-Crime scene and meeting place.
-Have you worked here a long time?

1526
00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:44.110
-More than ten years?
-Yes.

1527
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:45.230
-Are you from around here?
-From Malmö? No.

1528
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:46.990
I'm from Copenhagen.
I was born there.

1529
00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:49.470
No wonder Ingmar Bergman
and Lars Norén are from Sweden.

1530
00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:50.740
-Are you related to Lars Norén?
-No.

1531
00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:51.980
We need to find the meeting place
and the crime scene.

1532
00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:53.200
Where did the perpetrator
meet the victim?

1533
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:57.860
I've spoken to Copenhagen.
You'll cooperate on the deaths.

1534
00:48:58.070 --> 00:48:58.900
Here's info about your authority.

1535
00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:00.100
I know what applies to me
in Denmark.

1536
00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:01.490
-Can I have a word with you, Saga?
-Yes.

1537
00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:03.880
The report you filed
against Martin...

1538
00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:04.550
Yes, there's only one.

1539
00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:05.560
What do you suggest I do with it?

1540
00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:06.560
Don't you think
it will affect your cooperation?

1541
00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:07.670
-Do you think so?
-I think there's every chance.

1542
00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:08.970
-Will he dislike me?
-That might happen.

1543
00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:10.530
Because of my report?
It doesn't have to affect the case.

1544
00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:11.570
He let an ambulance through.
No life was in danger.

1545
00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:12.580
-I'm supposed to file a report.
-I'll handle the report.

1546
00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:14.240
-Yes, that's fine. Fine.
-I've got the car's license number.

1547
00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:15.090
It belongs to Daniel Farbé in Malmö.

1548
00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:16.000
-The journalist?
-Yes, he's a journalist.

1549
00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:19.230
-Do you know who he is?
-Yes. I read his column.

1550
00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:20.520
It's entertaining.

1551
00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:35.420
-You made me jump.
-I worked all night.

1552
00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:36.650
-I'm done for the week. Berlin next.
-You work all night.

1553
00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:37.550
Then you get down in Berlin.
How do you manage?

1554
00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:38.720
Get down?
How many children have you got?

1555
00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:39.640
Children that suck the life
out of you.

1556
00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.330
I haven't got children. No one says
"get down" any more. No one.

1557
00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:42.620
-Have fun.
-I will.

1558
00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:43.330
I downloaded
"Elephants in the Desert".

1559
00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:44.400
What do you want, Åke?

1560
00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.500
A hug, an award, an applause?
Would you like one?

1561
00:49:46.090 --> 00:49:47.240
-They're really cool. I like them.
-Yes, they were cool.

1562
00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.670
What?
Two weeks ago you really liked them.

1563
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:49.260
And now you like them.

1564
00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:50.330
My daughter...

1565
00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:52.450
-She danced all afternoon.
-Sorry, I have to answer.

1566
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:53.830
We'll have to continue this later.

1567
00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:56.550
You and the boys will disappear.

1568
00:49:56.590 --> 00:49:57.450
Your paperwork
and your debts are gone.

1569
00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:59.190
You can make a fresh start.
Do you understand?

1570
00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:01.380
You can make a fresh start.
There's cash and a mobile here.

1571
00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:03.060
But you can never see or talk to
your husband again.

1572
00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.660
He's their dad.
I have to let them see him.

1573
00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:05.740
Why? Why do they have to?

1574
00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:07.980
To get another beating?
To be scared and broke?

1575
00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:09.540
Let him spend everything on drugs?
He'll ruin everything for you again.

1576
00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:10.600
People like him ruin things.

1577
00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:12.270
You don't know me.
Why are you doing this?

1578
00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:15.330
Because I can.

1579
00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:27.290
Bloody hell.

1580
00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:36.360
-Here's my car.
-Do you think it's him?

1581
00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.620
He kept a body in a freezer
and killed a politician.

1582
00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:38.710
-He wouldn't use his own car.
-Nice car.

1583
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:40.010
-Is the Swedish police paid well?
-No, the same as in Denmark.

1584
00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:41.440
Don't jump to conclusions
about my wages based on my car.

1585
00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:42.730
Maybe it was a gift?
Maybe I inherited it or had savings?

1586
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:44.000
I hope your professional conclusions
are more valid.

1587
00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:45.290
Read this.
It's Daniel Ferbé's latest column.

1588
00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:46.580
-The one that's a good writer?
-No, I said he's entertaining.

1589
00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:47.250
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

1590
00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:00.980
Hello? What's going on?

1591
00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:02.330
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-A Cadillac has a bomb in it.

1592
00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:03.370
Is it a black Escalade?
It's tied to a double homicide.

1593
00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:04.900
-Is the guy trying to kill himself?
-I don't think he was involved.

1594
00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:06.230
No, you're not going
anywhere near the place.

1595
00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:14.750
Help! Help!

1596
00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:15.640
-Take it easy.
-Please help me!

1597
00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:16.800
-Help me! Get me out!
-Calm down.

1598
00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:19.340
-Help me!
-The windshield is wired in.

1599
00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:20.330
The side windows are
connected to the electrical system.

1600
00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:21.760
The glass seems OK,
but there are wires everywhere.

1601
00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:24.400
We've got his contact details.

1602
00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:29.690
-What's going on?
-My mobile!

1603
00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:30.930
-Yes?
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

1604
00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:32.340
I need to know whether you were
on the bridge last night.

1605
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:33.440
-What?
-Were you on the Öresund Bridge?

1606
00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:34.550
I was working.
I was here all the time.

1607
00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:35.920
-How will you get me out?
-I don't know, that's not my job.

1608
00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.030
-Do you know Kerstin Ekwall?
-Who?

1609
00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:37.960
Daniel? Did you do anything
apart from turn the key?

1610
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.340
No. Everything locked.
The countdown started.

1611
00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:40.170
-Hello?
-I'm talking to the bomb guy.

1612
00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:40.980
Chairman of the City Council
Kerstin Ekwall.

1613
00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:42.470
-Have you written about her?
-No, I don't know.

1614
00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:43.590
-Have you been tipped off about her?
-No! What is this?

1615
00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:44.290
Get me out! Please!

1616
00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:45.450
Does anyone else
have a key to your car?

1617
00:51:45.490 --> 00:51:46.890
-No, I don't know.
-Can you reach it?

1618
00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:47.810
I don't want to die. Please.

1619
00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:49.130
-I don't want it to end like this.
-Daniel? You need to talk to me.

1620
00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:51.710
It skipped a minute.
What the hell did you do?

1621
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.500
It was three, now it's two.
It was three.

1622
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.920
Come one, hurry up.

1623
00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:56.220
Where are you going?
Stay here! Please!

1624
00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:58.410
Please! Come back!
Where are you going?

1625
00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:03.060
You need to talk to me.
Daniel? Daniel?

1626
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:04.030
Is it a big bomb?

1627
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:06.130
-I think so.
-You're not religious, right?

1628
00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:06.840
You're an atheist?

1629
00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.400
Everything will just stop. The body
won't have time to register pain.

1630
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:10.930
-Are you sure?
-Don't look at the clock. Listen.

1631
00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:12.370
Do you know why your car
was used to dump two bodies?

1632
00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:13.860
-No.
-Think about it. Focus.

1633
00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:15.280
-Who did this to you?
-I've slagged so many people off.

1634
00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:19.500
Daniel? Are you still there? Hello?

1635
00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:26.870
It's clean.

1636
00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:29.930
Sorry about the drama, it's hard
to make oneself heard today.

1637
00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:30.750
I assume I have your attention now.

1638
00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:32.390
Our part of the world would be
wonderful if we solved our problems.

1639
00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:33.260
I would like to
point out five in particular.

1640
00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:34.920
This is only a beginning. We've got
interesting times ahead of us.

1641
00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:35.820
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-Copenhagen Police.

1642
00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:36.550
-Do you know who she is?
-Yes.

1643
00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:38.510
Excuse me. A woman insists on
speaking to the person in charge.

1644
00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.050
-Is she in Sweden or Denmark?
-I don't know.

1645
00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.720
She's Swedish, and the car came
from Sweden. I assume I'm in charge.

1646
00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:44.250
-Saga Norén. Can I help you?
-When will you let traffic through?

1647
00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:45.350
-It might take up to two hours.
-I haven't got two hours!

1648
00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:46.150
-Back up.
-Is someone's life in danger?

1649
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:46.960
There's a heart for my husband
in Copenhagen.

1650
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.080
He needs a heart transplant.
Let us through.

1651
00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:49.070
He'll have to wait.
I can't let anyone through.

1652
00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.560
-What's happened?
-Is there no other way through?

1653
00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:51.600
There ought to be
another way through.

1654
00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:53.090
-No one's answering any questions.
-Let me pass, please.

1655
00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:56.930
The Öresund Bridge to Denmark
is closed.

1656
00:52:56.970 --> 00:52:57.850
According to the police it will...

1657
00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:03.770
-It's Stefan Lindberg.
-Hi, it's Veronika.

1658
00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:05.190
-Sorry, did I wake you up?
-No, you didn't. How are you?

1659
00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:06.420
I can't sleep.
I've got a stomach ache.

1660
00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:07.520
-I see. How are the boys?
-They're asleep.

1661
00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:08.600
They don't understand
what's about to happen.

1662
00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:09.920
-Can we meet up?
-Now?

1663
00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:11.390
Of course.
Do you want me to come over?

1664
00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:13.230
-No. I'd rather go to your place.
-OK.

1665
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:14.210
-I can go to the office.
-I'll see you there.

1666
00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:17.860
Give me everything from
when the car came on to the bridge.

1667
00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:19.130
One camera records at a time.
They're started manually.

1668
00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:20.030
My colleague
might have recorded something.

1669
00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:21.100
Hello! Stop! Stop!

1670
00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:22.480
-Stop! Stop!
-I allowed it.

1671
00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:23.790
-Why? This is a crime scene.
-I'm fully aware of that.

1672
00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:24.580
-We've got enough bodies.
-He wasn't dying.

1673
00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:25.640
-Are you a doctor?
-No, I'm a police officer.

1674
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:27.400
-What's your name?
-Martin Rohde.

1675
00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:28.340
-Rohde?
-R, O, H, D, E.

1676
00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:30.060
-Have you got an ID?
-It was an ambulance.

1677
00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:31.290
The Chairman
of Malmö City Council is dead.

1678
00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:32.630
-What evidence was destroyed?
-Probably none.

1679
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:33.180
Thank you.

1680
00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:40.470
Hello. Hi. Finally.

1681
00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:41.920
I wont operate on Göran, Charlotte.
I had wine with my dinner.

1682
00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.810
-At what time? Are you drunk?
-No, but that doesn't matter.

1683
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:45.130
You promised to see us through this.

1684
00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:46.250
-Morten Krag is a very good surgeon.
-Better than you?

1685
00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:47.160
I'll decide
who my husband's surgeon is!

1686
00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:48.670
-I wont forgive you if it goes wrong.
-What if I do it and it goes wrong?

1687
00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:50.230
Then I'll never forgive myself.

1688
00:53:54.130 --> 00:53:55.340
-We're done, you can move her.
-You can take her away.

1689
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.960
Bloody hell.

1690
00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:03.450
The autopsy on Kerstin Ekwall
is being performed.

1691
00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:04.410
-And the recordings?
-They'll deliver them tomorrow.

1692
00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:05.210
-What about the press?
-They know.

1693
00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:06.310
The radio said that it was a woman.
They don't know who it is.

1694
00:54:06.350 --> 00:54:07.630
-And the family?
-I'm on my way to see them.

1695
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:09.160
You'll wake them up, and there
are children there. Tread lightly.

1696
00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:10.750
In what sense? Oh. There aren't
that many ways to say it.

1697
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:11.550
-Just tread lightly.
-Listen, Hans...

1698
00:54:11.590 --> 00:54:12.290
She was chopped in half.

1699
00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:13.400
-Right above the hips.
-What the hell are you saying?

1700
00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:15.480
She was due to attend a conference
in Copenhagen this morning.

1701
00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:16.840
-Have you got more computers?
-No.

1702
00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:17.770
Are you taking them?
The children's as well?

1703
00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:18.950
-When did you last talk to her?
-She called yesterday.

1704
00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:20.000
-Do you know what time it was?
-I don't know.

1705
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:21.070
Around half past six in the evening.

1706
00:54:21.110 --> 00:54:21.910
-Was she threatened?
-By whom?

1707
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:22.720
I didn't say that she was,
I asked you.

1708
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.660
Not really. She was a politician,
there were some calls and emails.

1709
00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:26.150
-Has she upset anyone lately?
-Lately...

1710
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:27.390
She wanted to charge for
library loans. Some disapproved.

1711
00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:28.410
-That's foolish.
-Sorry, what?

1712
00:54:28.450 --> 00:54:30.050
Reading becomes a money matter.
Social differences will grow.

1713
00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:31.010
-Is that why she was...?
-We don't know why.

1714
00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:31.790
It's unlikely
that library fees caused it.

1715
00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:33.040
Why? Why did someone do this?

1716
00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:34.730
Can you think of something personal?
Was she in debt? Did she use drugs?

1717
00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:35.500
Did she have an affair?

1718
00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:39.910
Saga Norén.

1719
00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:40.980
Can't we talk on the phone?

1720
00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:42.450
I'll be there in twenty minutes. Bye.

1721
00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:54.370
August?

1722
00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:08.210
-Were you on the bridge?
-Yes.

1723
00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:09.270
-What happened?
-A murder, the Swedes will handle it.

1724
00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:10.120
-Did you check on August?
-Yes.

1725
00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.040
-Is he asleep?
-Yes.

1726
00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:12.150
You promised to talk to him.
He's become a night owl.

1727
00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:12.960
Do you want me to
wake him up now?

1728
00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:14.590
-He got up at three o'clock today.
-I'll have a word with him tomorrow.

1729
00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:18.710
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

1730
00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:25.950
-Do you know the cause of death?
-I can make a qualified guess.

1731
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.930
She died six to eight hours ago.

1732
00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:28.220
Yes, she called home at six thirty
and was dumped just after midnight.

1733
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:29.440
There's something else.

1734
00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:30.120
-What?
-Take a look.

1735
00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:38.900
No livor mortis on the ears.
That's consistent with the bleeding.

1736
00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:39.650
Petechiae on the conjunctivas.

1737
00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:41.030
The face is swollen.

1738
00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:43.110
She was strangled
and cut in half after death.

1739
00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:43.910
And the other half?

1740
00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:46.530
The lower body is much paler.
A lot paler.

1741
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:48.390
It's not coherent with the bleeding
or how the body was placed.

1742
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:50.610
There's brown discoloration.
Frostbite?

1743
00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.030
It feels different. Frostbite.

1744
00:55:52.070 --> 00:55:52.790
Not frostbite, deep-freezing.

1745
00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:54.020
For about a year, I think.
I've never seen anything like this.

1746
00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:55.310
I don't know who they belong to.
They're not Kerstin Ekwall's legs.

1747
00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:01.890
-So everyone's here, then.
-Yes.

1748
00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:02.430
Hi, Sebastian.

1749
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:04.250
I don't know what to do.

1750
00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:05.330
I'm worried about tomorrow.
I had to see you.

1751
00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:06.140
Can't you just pay the rent?

1752
00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:07.620
They can't evict the children.
Can they? Their friends are there.

1753
00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:08.460
I paid out money for the rent.

1754
00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.010
-Why did you bring the children?
-Sören wasn't there.

1755
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:11.020
I can't manage.

1756
00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:12.430
-Can't you make an exception?
-No. You know I can't.

1757
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:13.440
-Please.
-There are guidelines. I'm sorry.

1758
00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:18.890
Charlotte Söringer? I'm Frederik
Henriksen, hospital administrator.

1759
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:20.770
-Göran had atrial fibrillation.
-They managed to stop it.

1760
00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:21.850
-He's to weak for surgery.
-Too weak?

1761
00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:23.070
-But there's a new heart.
-It will be given to someone else.

1762
00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.410
Anders said
that you need a new CT scanner.

1763
00:56:24.450 --> 00:56:26.030
My husband's business is doing well.
He's willing to donate a CT scanner.

1764
00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:26.840
We're cancelling for his own sake.

1765
00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:28.200
He'll die without a new heart.
I want both parties to benefit.

1766
00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.880
Pass my offer on
to the proper authority, please.

1767
00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:36.220
-Hello? Is this Martin Rohde?
-Yes.

1768
00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:37.390
-It's Saga Norén from the bridge.
-Yes, I remember.

1769
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:39.080
-Were you asleep?
-I tend to doze off around this time.

1770
00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:39.970
-There were two women.
-You found another one.

1771
00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:40.940
The lower body
belonged to someone else.

1772
00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:42.240
-Have you found half a body?
-I don't know.

1773
00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:43.770
It could be more than a year ago.
The legs have been deep-frozen.

1774
00:56:43.810 --> 00:56:44.970
-Can you look into it? Now?
-First thing tomorrow morning.

1775
00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:46.190
Can someone else
look into it straight away?

1776
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:47.920
-I'll call you back.
-When?

1777
00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:50.450
-Do you have to get up?
-Yes.

1778
00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:58.450
Missing woman, Caucasian,
at least a year ago...

1779
00:56:58.490 --> 00:56:59.150
-How old?
-Adult.

1780
00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.190
-And life in general is OK?
-Yes.

1781
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.910
-What about you?
-I'm fine.

1782
00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:02.730
-So you'll be firing blanks.
-Was it in the staff news bulletin?

1783
00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:04.170
-Is everything working as it should?
-It will in time.

1784
00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:04.850
It can't be much fun.

1785
00:57:04.890 --> 00:57:06.080
-What do you mean?
-You've heard about castrated toms?

1786
00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:07.780
A wild predator turns into
a chunky sleepyhead. Just like that.

1787
00:57:08.370 --> 00:57:09.670
They're castrated,
that's not the same thing.

1788
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.840
Let's see what we've got.

1789
00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:12.140
Two women killed a year apart.

1790
00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:13.390
One was deep-frozen.
They were dismembered.

1791
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:15.050
And assembled on the bridge.
Someone wants to make a statement.

1792
00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:17.820
-Saga Norén.
-It's Martin.

1793
00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:19.320
The lower body is Monique Brammer,
I think. A missing 23-year-old.

1794
00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.130
-Can you email the info?
-I'll be right over.

1795
00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:21.150
-Why do you want to come here?
-She's Danish.

1796
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:22.360
I was first on the scene.
Everyone's still asleep here.

1797
00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:23.230
-Do you mind if I come over?
-Yes.

1798
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:24.390
Make sure I'm allowed in.
You've got my details.

1799
00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:26.270
Martin Rohde has probably identified
the second body. He's coming over.

1800
00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:27.440
-Is that a problem?
-Yes...

1801
00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:28.310
No, no.

1802
00:57:28.350 --> 00:57:29.800
If half of the body is Danish,
we have to cooperate.

1803
00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:30.570
I'll schedule a meeting
at half past five.

1804
00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:31.570
-Can you be ready by then?
-Yes.

1805
00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:39.150
It finally worked out.

1806
00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:42.640
-What did you just sign?
-Formalities.

1807
00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:44.300
-Whose is it?
-What?

1808
00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:44.930
The heart. Whose is it?

1809
00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:46.020
A man's. He's 25 or 26
and had a motorcycle accident.

1810
00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:48.240
-What's his name?
-I don't know. Does it matter?

1811
00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:49.910
No, I guess it doesn't.

1812
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:52.220
-I'm scared.
-It will be fine.

1813
00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.000
Anders will operate, they're all
highly skilled. It will be fine.

1814
00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:54.930
I can't imagine life without you.

1815
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:57.430
-I need to take Göran with me.
-Don't worry. You'll make it, honey.

1816
00:57:58.580 --> 00:57:59.190
-Hi.
-Hi.

1817
00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:00.030
-Hi! An early breakfast?
-No thank you.

1818
00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:01.440
-An email would have been faster.
-Yes, but not as pleasant.

1819
00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:03.200
-Where are you going?
-I'm coming in with you.

1820
00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:05.430
If it really is Monique Brammer,
we both have responsibilities.

1821
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:07.150
Go straight on,
turn left, and register.

1822
00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:11.400
-Good morning. Coffee?
-No thanks, I've already had some.

1823
00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:12.770
I'm Martin Rohde.
I'll be working with Saga.

1824
00:58:12.810 --> 00:58:14.340
-Thank you. You need to register.
-I also need a card.

1825
00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:15.130
-My name's Felicia.
-Nice to meet you.

1826
00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:16.490
-That's it. This is for you.
-Thank you.

1827
00:58:16.530 --> 00:58:17.790
-And one of these is for you.
-Thanks! Ooh, Danish.

1828
00:58:18.810 --> 00:58:19.450
-See you later.
-I hope so.

1829
00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:23.310
-Where's Saga Norén?
-To the right. Bye!

1830
00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:27.190
Excuse me.

1831
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:28.040
-Sit down.
-I'm afraid I can't.

1832
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:30.560
-You make me nervous.
-OK, I can stand still.

1833
00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:31.880
-Why can't you sit down?
-My nether regions hurt.

1834
00:58:32.330 --> 00:58:33.680
-I had a vasectomy yesterday.
-Right.

1835
00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:34.550
I've got five children
with three different women.

1836
00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:35.900
-Have you got children?
-No, why would I want to?

1837
00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:37.010
-I've never heard anyone ask that.
-Many should have.

1838
00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:39.190
Not you,
I'm sure you're a wonderful dad.

1839
00:58:41.570 --> 00:58:42.870
-Why aren't you off sick?
-I can't afford it. August moved in.

1840
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:44.660
Well, it's not really about money.
It was a small procedure, I can work.

1841
00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:45.560
-You can't sit down.
-I can.

1842
00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:46.670
-I drove here.
-Pretend that the chair is a car.

1843
00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:48.920
Yes.

1844
00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:52.530
-No one wanted to solve the case.
-What do you mean?

1845
00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:53.410
Monique Brammer
was reported missing.

1846
00:58:53.450 --> 00:58:54.940
Two prostitutes and a neighbour were
interviewed. The case was shelved.

1847
00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:55.840
It fell between two stools.

1848
00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:57.120
She disappeared, or she was killed.
They didn't find a body.

1849
00:58:57.540 --> 00:58:58.270
The case was
supposed to be shelved.

1850
00:58:58.310 --> 00:58:59.490
I'm surprised it took two weeks.
Come with me.

1851
00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:03.890
Do you think I should?
I tried painkillers, but...

1852
00:59:04.650 --> 00:59:05.460
-Two computers?
-They know who it is now.

1853
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:06.260
-Will Saga handle the case, Hans?
-Yes.

1854
00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:07.190
-That's good.
-And a Danish police officer.

1855
00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:08.980
-Does he know that she's a bit odd?
-If not, he'll soon find out.

1856
00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:11.340
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

1857
00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:12.590
-This is Martin Röhde.
-It's Rohde.

1858
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:13.890
Not as when you say "fur".
Rohde, Foure...

1859
00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:15.880
-Have you read the file?
-Most people have just arrived.

1860
00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:16.950
Half of two female bodies were found.
One was Kerstin Ekwall.

1861
00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:17.730
The other one has been deep-frozen.
Martin?

1862
00:59:17.770 --> 00:59:19.090
It's probably the 23-year-old
Monique Brammer from Copenhagen.

1863
00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:20.310
A prostitute and an addict
that went missing 13 months ago.

1864
00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:21.950
Do you want me to repeat that?
A bit slower?

1865
00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:23.100
Monique Brammer, 23 years old.
A prostitute and an addict.

1866
00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:24.000
She went missing 13 months ago.

1867
00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:25.570
-Right.
-The investigation was inadequate.

1868
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:27.890
-Don't you agree?
-Yes. It was terrible.

1869
00:59:27.930 --> 00:59:29.000
But we found blood traces
in her apartment.

1870
00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.390
The samples are on their way
and can be compared to the body.

1871
00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:31.620
Before the bodies were dumped,
the power was cut for 48 seconds.

1872
00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:32.640
Their trying to trace the signal.
Can you help them, Gry?

1873
00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:33.660
-How was it done?
-Someone accessed a computer.

1874
00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:34.140
Can you show me the fourth picture?

1875
00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:35.180
Use all the people you need. Gry?

1876
00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:36.560
Here's Ekwall's mobile number.
Get the phone records.

1877
00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:37.700
Check her computers.
Talk to John about passwords.

1878
00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:38.610
Anne?
Find out where she was abducted.

1879
00:59:38.650 --> 00:59:39.840
She left work half past six.
She had a car. Find it!

1880
00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:41.280
-Were they dumped from her car?
-No, a black Cadillac Escalade.

1881
00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:42.740
The image where the bridge
is seen from above.

1882
00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:44.100
-John can find the license number.
-What? Sure.

1883
00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:45.090
-What are you doing?
-I had an idea.

1884
00:59:45.130 --> 00:59:46.620
The orange line the body was on...
We discussed where she was.

1885
00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:47.470
Here's the Swedish-Danish border.

1886
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:48.570
One half is in Sweden,
one is in Denmark.

1887
00:59:48.610 --> 00:59:49.680
-It's millimetre perfect.
-Tell me everything about the line.

1888
00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:50.310
Take paint samples.

1889
00:59:50.350 --> 00:59:51.880
Power cut, body halves, a politician.
We'll be in the public eye.

1890
01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:01.890
-Hi. Is Veronika at home?
-Yes.

1891
01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:02.780
-What do you want?
-I would like to talk to her.

1892
01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:04.020
-You can talk to me.
-I would if you were clean.

1893
01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:05.200
-What? I am clean.
-Hi, Veronika.

1894
01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:06.680
-Isn't it enough to have us evicted?
-The landlord did that.

1895
01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:08.590
-You're not helping.
-I'm trying. I'm trying really hard.

1896
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:10.090
If you had been more dependable,
you wouldn't have to move.

1897
01:00:11.070 --> 01:00:12.520
-That was bloody stupid.
-Sören! Stop it!

1898
01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:15.120
What the hell?

1899
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:17.400
Stop, you bastard!

1900
01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:19.910
Stop! Come out!

1901
01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:23.570
Sören! Stop it, Sören! Stop it!

1902
01:00:23.610 --> 01:00:24.490
-I hate that bloody bastard!
-Sören!

1903
01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:26.230
He's caused trouble all along.
It makes me so angry!

1904
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:27.740
Let go of me.
Go to hell, you bloody idiots.

1905
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:38.300
-How's the operation going?
-It hasn't started.

1906
01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:39.430
-Why? He was prepared hours ago.
-I don't know.

1907
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:40.160
I'm afraid I have to go.

1908
01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:41.690
-Don't you know where he is?
-You probably know better than me.

1909
01:00:41.730 --> 01:00:43.130
We'll call you if we hear from him...
Let's go.

1910
01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.860
-I'm sorry about all of this.
-Stop apologizing for him.

1911
01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:46.760
He's an adult
and makes his own decisions.

1912
01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.390
Maybe you should do the same?
Sören put you in this position.

1913
01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:49.970
You spend your money wisely,
but can't if you're not given any.

1914
01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:51.380
You don't get the chance
to care for your boys.

1915
01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:52.950
-He hits you and the children.
-Hardly ever the children.

1916
01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:53.980
Hardly ever? That's not good enough.

1917
01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:55.070
He shouldn't hit any of you.

1918
01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:57.020
You can get your life back on track.
Just you and the children.

1919
01:00:58.190 --> 01:00:59.060
Leave your husband
or nothing will change.

1920
01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:00.390
Think about it.

1921
01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:05.080
-Anders? What's going on?
-We've got a problem.

1922
01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.550
The donor was declared brain dead,
and a nurse spoke to his father.

1923
01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:07.910
The father changed his mind.
We can't have the heart. Göran!

1924
01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:14.810
Wasn't that the turn-off?

1925
01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:16.520
-Stefan? Wasn't that the turn-off?
-No, not today.

1926
01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.170
-Where are we going?
-You'll see.

1927
01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.040
Johan was nicknamed "The old bag".
He died a month ago.

1928
01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:28.910
No wife, no children, no debts,
no assets. The house was all he had.

1929
01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:29.920
It went to the local council.

1930
01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:33.170
It's Sören.

1931
01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.100
Come.

1932
01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:44.280
-Step inside.
-What about the children?

1933
01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.000
They can stay outside a while longer.

1934
01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.890
-Where are we? Why are we here?
-Just go inside.

1935
01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.250
-Crime scene and meeting place.
-Have you worked here a long time?

1936
01:01:52.290 --> 01:01:52.840
-More than ten years?
-Yes.

1937
01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:53.960
-Are you from around here?
-From Malmö? No.

1938
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.720
I'm from Copenhagen.
I was born there.

1939
01:01:56.310 --> 01:01:58.200
No wonder Ingmar Bergman
and Lars Norén are from Sweden.

1940
01:01:58.410 --> 01:01:59.470
-Are you related to Lars Norén?
-No.

1941
01:01:59.810 --> 01:02:00.710
We need to find the meeting place
and the crime scene.

1942
01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:01.930
Where did the perpetrator
meet the victim?

1943
01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.590
I've spoken to Copenhagen.
You'll cooperate on the deaths.

1944
01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:07.630
Here's info about your authority.

1945
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:08.830
I know what applies to me
in Denmark.

1946
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:10.220
-Can I have a word with you, Saga?
-Yes.

1947
01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:12.610
The report you filed
against Martin...

1948
01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:13.280
Yes, there's only one.

1949
01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:14.290
What do you suggest I do with it?

1950
01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:15.290
Don't you think
it will affect your cooperation?

1951
01:02:15.570 --> 01:02:16.400
-Do you think so?
-I think there's every chance.

1952
01:02:16.590 --> 01:02:17.700
-Will he dislike me?
-That might happen.

1953
01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:19.260
Because of my report?
It doesn't have to affect the case.

1954
01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:20.300
He let an ambulance through.
No life was in danger.

1955
01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:21.310
-I'm supposed to file a report.
-I'll handle the report.

1956
01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:22.970
-Yes, that's fine. Fine.
-I've got the car's license number.

1957
01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:23.820
It belongs to Daniel Farbé in Malmö.

1958
01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:24.730
-The journalist?
-Yes, he's a journalist.

1959
01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:27.960
-Do you know who he is?
-Yes. I read his column.

1960
01:02:28.690 --> 01:02:29.250
It's entertaining.

1961
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:44.150
-You made me jump.
-I worked all night.

1962
01:02:44.190 --> 01:02:45.380
-I'm done for the week. Berlin next.
-You work all night.

1963
01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:46.280
Then you get down in Berlin.
How do you manage?

1964
01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:47.450
Get down?
How many children have you got?

1965
01:02:47.490 --> 01:02:48.370
Children that suck the life
out of you.

1966
01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:50.060
I haven't got children. No one says
"get down" any more. No one.

1967
01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:51.350
-Have fun.
-I will.

1968
01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:52.060
I downloaded
"Elephants in the Desert".

1969
01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:53.130
What do you want, Åke?

1970
01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:54.230
A hug, an award, an applause?
Would you like one?

1971
01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:55.970
-They're really cool. I like them.
-Yes, they were cool.

1972
01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:57.400
What?
Two weeks ago you really liked them.

1973
01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:57.990
And now you like them.

1974
01:02:58.530 --> 01:02:59.060
My daughter...

1975
01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:01.180
-She danced all afternoon.
-Sorry, I have to answer.

1976
01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:02.560
We'll have to continue this later.

1977
01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:05.280
You and the boys will disappear.

1978
01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:06.180
Your paperwork
and your debts are gone.

1979
01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:07.920
You can make a fresh start.
Do you understand?

1980
01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:10.110
You can make a fresh start.
There's cash and a mobile here.

1981
01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.790
But you can never see or talk to
your husband again.

1982
01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:13.390
He's their dad.
I have to let them see him.

1983
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:14.470
Why? Why do they have to?

1984
01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:16.710
To get another beating?
To be scared and broke?

1985
01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:18.270
Let him spend everything on drugs?
He'll ruin everything for you again.

1986
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:19.330
People like him ruin things.

1987
01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:21.000
You don't know me.
Why are you doing this?

1988
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:24.060
Because I can.

1989
01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.020
Bloody hell.

1990
01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.090
-Here's my car.
-Do you think it's him?

1991
01:03:45.130 --> 01:03:46.350
He kept a body in a freezer
and killed a politician.

1992
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:47.440
-He wouldn't use his own car.
-Nice car.

1993
01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.740
-Is the Swedish police paid well?
-No, the same as in Denmark.

1994
01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:50.170
Don't jump to conclusions
about my wages based on my car.

1995
01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:51.460
Maybe it was a gift?
Maybe I inherited it or had savings?

1996
01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:52.730
I hope your professional conclusions
are more valid.

1997
01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:54.020
Read this.
It's Daniel Ferbé's latest column.

1998
01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:55.310
-The one that's a good writer?
-No, I said he's entertaining.

1999
01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:55.980
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

2000
01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:09.710
Hello? What's going on?

2001
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:11.060
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-A Cadillac has a bomb in it.

2002
01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:12.100
Is it a black Escalade?
It's tied to a double homicide.

2003
01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:13.630
-Is the guy trying to kill himself?
-I don't think he was involved.

2004
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:14.960
No, you're not going
anywhere near the place.

2005
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:23.480
Help! Help!

2006
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:24.370
-Take it easy.
-Please help me!

2007
01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:25.530
-Help me! Get me out!
-Calm down.

2008
01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:28.070
-Help me!
-The windshield is wired in.

2009
01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:29.060
The side windows are
connected to the electrical system.

2010
01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:30.490
The glass seems OK,
but there are wires everywhere.

2011
01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:33.130
We've got his contact details.

2012
01:04:37.470 --> 01:04:38.420
-What's going on?
-My mobile!

2013
01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:39.660
-Yes?
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

2014
01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:41.070
I need to know whether you were
on the bridge last night.

2015
01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:42.170
-What?
-Were you on the Öresund Bridge?

2016
01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:43.280
I was working.
I was here all the time.

2017
01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:44.650
-How will you get me out?
-I don't know, that's not my job.

2018
01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:45.760
-Do you know Kerstin Ekwall?
-Who?

2019
01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:46.690
Daniel? Did you do anything
apart from turn the key?

2020
01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:48.070
No. Everything locked.
The countdown started.

2021
01:04:48.110 --> 01:04:48.900
-Hello?
-I'm talking to the bomb guy.

2022
01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:49.710
Chairman of the City Council
Kerstin Ekwall.

2023
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:51.200
-Have you written about her?
-No, I don't know.

2024
01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.320
-Have you been tipped off about her?
-No! What is this?

2025
01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:53.020
Get me out! Please!

2026
01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:54.180
Does anyone else
have a key to your car?

2027
01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:55.620
-No, I don't know.
-Can you reach it?

2028
01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:56.540
I don't want to die. Please.

2029
01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:57.860
-I don't want it to end like this.
-Daniel? You need to talk to me.

2030
01:04:59.050 --> 01:05:00.440
It skipped a minute.
What the hell did you do?

2031
01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:02.230
It was three, now it's two.
It was three.

2032
01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:03.650
Come one, hurry up.

2033
01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:04.950
Where are you going?
Stay here! Please!

2034
01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:07.140
Please! Come back!
Where are you going?

2035
01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:11.790
You need to talk to me.
Daniel? Daniel?

2036
01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:12.760
Is it a big bomb?

2037
01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:14.860
-I think so.
-You're not religious, right?

2038
01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:15.570
You're an atheist?

2039
01:05:15.610 --> 01:05:17.130
Everything will just stop. The body
won't have time to register pain.

2040
01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:19.660
-Are you sure?
-Don't look at the clock. Listen.

2041
01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:21.100
Do you know why your car
was used to dump two bodies?

2042
01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:22.590
-No.
-Think about it. Focus.

2043
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:24.010
-Who did this to you?
-I've slagged so many people off.

2044
01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:28.230
Daniel? Are you still there? Hello?

2045
01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:35.600
It's clean.

2046
01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:38.660
Sorry about the drama, it's hard
to make oneself heard today.

2047
01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:39.480
I assume I have your attention now.

2048
01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.120
Our part of the world would be
wonderful if we solved our problems.

2049
01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:41.990
I would like to
point out five in particular.

2050
01:05:42.030 --> 01:05:43.650
This is only a beginning. We've got
interesting times ahead of us.

2051
01:05:43.650 --> 01:05:44.550
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-Copenhagen Police.

2052
01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:45.280
-Do you know who she is?
-Yes.

2053
01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.240
Excuse me. A woman insists on
speaking to the person in charge.

2054
01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:48.780
-Is she in Sweden or Denmark?
-I don't know.

2055
01:05:49.050 --> 01:05:50.450
She's Swedish, and the car came
from Sweden. I assume I'm in charge.

2056
01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:52.980
-Saga Norén. Can I help you?
-When will you let traffic through?

2057
01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:54.080
-It might take up to two hours.
-I haven't got two hours!

2058
01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:54.880
-Back up.
-Is someone's life in danger?

2059
01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:55.690
There's a heart for my husband
in Copenhagen.

2060
01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:56.810
He needs a heart transplant.
Let us through.

2061
01:05:56.850 --> 01:05:57.800
He'll have to wait.
I can't let anyone through.

2062
01:05:58.170 --> 01:05:59.290
-What's happened?
-Is there no other way through?

2063
01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:00.330
There ought to be
another way through.

2064
01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:01.820
-No one's answering any questions.
-Let me pass, please.

2065
01:06:04.350 --> 01:06:05.660
The Öresund Bridge to Denmark
is closed.

2066
01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:06.580
According to the police it will...

2067
01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:12.500
-It's Stefan Lindberg.
-Hi, it's Veronika.

2068
01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:13.920
-Sorry, did I wake you up?
-No, you didn't. How are you?

2069
01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.150
I can't sleep.
I've got a stomach ache.

2070
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:16.250
-I see. How are the boys?
-They're asleep.

2071
01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:17.330
They don't understand
what's about to happen.

2072
01:06:17.370 --> 01:06:18.650
-Can we meet up?
-Now?

2073
01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:20.120
Of course.
Do you want me to come over?

2074
01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:21.960
-No. I'd rather go to your place.
-OK.

2075
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:22.940
-I can go to the office.
-I'll see you there.

2076
01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:26.590
Give me everything from
when the car came on to the bridge.

2077
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:27.860
One camera records at a time.
They're started manually.

2078
01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:28.760
My colleague
might have recorded something.

2079
01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:29.830
Hello! Stop! Stop!

2080
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:31.210
-Stop! Stop!
-I allowed it.

2081
01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:32.520
-Why? This is a crime scene.
-I'm fully aware of that.

2082
01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:33.310
-We've got enough bodies.
-He wasn't dying.

2083
01:06:33.350 --> 01:06:34.370
-Are you a doctor?
-No, I'm a police officer.

2084
01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.130
-What's your name?
-Martin Rohde.

2085
01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:37.070
-Rohde?
-R, O, H, D, E.

2086
01:06:37.110 --> 01:06:38.790
-Have you got an ID?
-It was an ambulance.

2087
01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:40.020
The Chairman
of Malmö City Council is dead.

2088
01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:41.360
-What evidence was destroyed?
-Probably none.

2089
01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:41.910
Thank you.

2090
01:06:48.350 --> 01:06:49.200
Hello. Hi. Finally.

2091
01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:50.650
I wont operate on Göran, Charlotte.
I had wine with my dinner.

2092
01:06:50.970 --> 01:06:52.540
-At what time? Are you drunk?
-No, but that doesn't matter.

2093
01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:53.860
You promised to see us through this.

2094
01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:54.980
-Morten Krag is a very good surgeon.
-Better than you?

2095
01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:55.890
I'll decide
who my husband's surgeon is!

2096
01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:57.400
-I wont forgive you if it goes wrong.
-What if I do it and it goes wrong?

2097
01:06:58.070 --> 01:06:58.960
Then I'll never forgive myself.

2098
01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:04.070
-We're done, you can move her.
-You can take her away.

2099
01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:06.690
Bloody hell.

2100
01:07:11.030 --> 01:07:12.180
The autopsy on Kerstin Ekwall
is being performed.

2101
01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:13.140
-And the recordings?
-They'll deliver them tomorrow.

2102
01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:13.940
-What about the press?
-They know.

2103
01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:15.040
The radio said that it was a woman.
They don't know who it is.

2104
01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.360
-And the family?
-I'm on my way to see them.

2105
01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.890
You'll wake them up, and there
are children there. Tread lightly.

2106
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:19.480
In what sense? Oh. There aren't
that many ways to say it.

2107
01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.280
-Just tread lightly.
-Listen, Hans...

2108
01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:21.020
She was chopped in half.

2109
01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:22.130
-Right above the hips.
-What the hell are you saying?

2110
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:24.210
She was due to attend a conference
in Copenhagen this morning.

2111
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:25.570
-Have you got more computers?
-No.

2112
01:07:25.610 --> 01:07:26.500
Are you taking them?
The children's as well?

2113
01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:27.680
-When did you last talk to her?
-She called yesterday.

2114
01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:28.730
-Do you know what time it was?
-I don't know.

2115
01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:29.800
Around half past six in the evening.

2116
01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:30.640
-Was she threatened?
-By whom?

2117
01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:31.450
I didn't say that she was,
I asked you.

2118
01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:33.390
Not really. She was a politician,
there were some calls and emails.

2119
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:34.880
-Has she upset anyone lately?
-Lately...

2120
01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.120
She wanted to charge for
library loans. Some disapproved.

2121
01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:37.140
-That's foolish.
-Sorry, what?

2122
01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:38.780
Reading becomes a money matter.
Social differences will grow.

2123
01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:39.740
-Is that why she was...?
-We don't know why.

2124
01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:40.520
It's unlikely
that library fees caused it.

2125
01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:41.770
Why? Why did someone do this?

2126
01:07:41.810 --> 01:07:43.460
Can you think of something personal?
Was she in debt? Did she use drugs?

2127
01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:44.230
Did she have an affair?

2128
01:07:48.050 --> 01:07:48.640
Saga Norén.

2129
01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:49.710
Can't we talk on the phone?

2130
01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:51.180
I'll be there in twenty minutes. Bye.

2131
01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:03.100
August?

2132
01:08:16.150 --> 01:08:16.940
-Were you on the bridge?
-Yes.

2133
01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:18.000
-What happened?
-A murder, the Swedes will handle it.

2134
01:08:18.270 --> 01:08:18.850
-Did you check on August?
-Yes.

2135
01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:19.770
-Is he asleep?
-Yes.

2136
01:08:19.810 --> 01:08:20.880
You promised to talk to him.
He's become a night owl.

2137
01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:21.690
Do you want me to
wake him up now?

2138
01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:23.320
-He got up at three o'clock today.
-I'll have a word with him tomorrow.

2139
01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:27.440
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

2140
01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:34.680
-Do you know the cause of death?
-I can make a qualified guess.

2141
01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:35.660
She died six to eight hours ago.

2142
01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:36.950
Yes, she called home at six thirty
and was dumped just after midnight.

2143
01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.170
There's something else.

2144
01:08:38.210 --> 01:08:38.850
-What?
-Take a look.

2145
01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:47.630
No livor mortis on the ears.
That's consistent with the bleeding.

2146
01:08:47.670 --> 01:08:48.380
Petechiae on the conjunctivas.

2147
01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:49.760
The face is swollen.

2148
01:08:50.850 --> 01:08:51.840
She was strangled
and cut in half after death.

2149
01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:52.640
And the other half?

2150
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:55.260
The lower body is much paler.
A lot paler.

2151
01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:57.120
It's not coherent with the bleeding
or how the body was placed.

2152
01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.340
There's brown discoloration.
Frostbite?

2153
01:08:59.610 --> 01:09:00.760
It feels different. Frostbite.

2154
01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:01.520
Not frostbite, deep-freezing.

2155
01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:02.750
For about a year, I think.
I've never seen anything like this.

2156
01:09:02.790 --> 01:09:04.040
I don't know who they belong to.
They're not Kerstin Ekwall's legs.

2157
01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:10.620
-So everyone's here, then.
-Yes.

2158
01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:11.160
Hi, Sebastian.

2159
01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:12.980
I don't know what to do.

2160
01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:14.060
I'm worried about tomorrow.
I had to see you.

2161
01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:14.870
Can't you just pay the rent?

2162
01:09:14.910 --> 01:09:16.350
They can't evict the children.
Can they? Their friends are there.

2163
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:17.190
I paid out money for the rent.

2164
01:09:17.770 --> 01:09:18.740
-Why did you bring the children?
-Sören wasn't there.

2165
01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:19.750
I can't manage.

2166
01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:21.160
-Can't you make an exception?
-No. You know I can't.

2167
01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.170
-Please.
-There are guidelines. I'm sorry.

2168
01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:27.620
Charlotte Söringer? I'm Frederik
Henriksen, hospital administrator.

2169
01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:29.500
-Göran had atrial fibrillation.
-They managed to stop it.

2170
01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:30.580
-He's to weak for surgery.
-Too weak?

2171
01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:31.800
-But there's a new heart.
-It will be given to someone else.

2172
01:09:32.170 --> 01:09:33.140
Anders said
that you need a new CT scanner.

2173
01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:34.760
My husband's business is doing well.
He's willing to donate a CT scanner.

2174
01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:35.570
We're cancelling for his own sake.

2175
01:09:35.610 --> 01:09:36.930
He'll die without a new heart.
I want both parties to benefit.

2176
01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:38.610
Pass my offer on
to the proper authority, please.

2177
01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:44.950
-Hello? Is this Martin Rohde?
-Yes.

2178
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:46.120
-It's Saga Norén from the bridge.
-Yes, I remember.

2179
01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:47.810
-Were you asleep?
-I tend to doze off around this time.

2180
01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:48.700
-There were two women.
-You found another one.

2181
01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:49.670
The lower body
belonged to someone else.

2182
01:09:49.710 --> 01:09:50.970
-Have you found half a body?
-I don't know.

2183
01:09:51.010 --> 01:09:52.500
It could be more than a year ago.
The legs have been deep-frozen.

2184
01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:53.700
-Can you look into it? Now?
-First thing tomorrow morning.

2185
01:09:53.970 --> 01:09:54.920
Can someone else
look into it straight away?

2186
01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:56.650
-I'll call you back.
-When?

2187
01:09:58.540 --> 01:09:59.180
-Do you have to get up?
-Yes.

2188
01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:07.180
Missing woman, Caucasian,
at least a year ago...

2189
01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:07.880
-How old?
-Adult.

2190
01:10:08.130 --> 01:10:08.920
-And life in general is OK?
-Yes.

2191
01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:09.640
-What about you?
-I'm fine.

2192
01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.460
-So you'll be firing blanks.
-Was it in the staff news bulletin?

2193
01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:12.900
-Is everything working as it should?
-It will in time.

2194
01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:13.580
It can't be much fun.

2195
01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:14.810
-What do you mean?
-You've heard about castrated toms?

2196
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:16.510
A wild predator turns into
a chunky sleepyhead. Just like that.

2197
01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:18.400
They're castrated,
that's not the same thing.

2198
01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:19.570
Let's see what we've got.

2199
01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:20.870
Two women killed a year apart.

2200
01:10:20.910 --> 01:10:22.120
One was deep-frozen.
They were dismembered.

2201
01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.780
And assembled on the bridge.
Someone wants to make a statement.

2202
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:26.550
-Saga Norén.
-It's Martin.

2203
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:28.050
The lower body is Monique Brammer,
I think. A missing 23-year-old.

2204
01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:28.860
-Can you email the info?
-I'll be right over.

2205
01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:29.880
-Why do you want to come here?
-She's Danish.

2206
01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:31.090
I was first on the scene.
Everyone's still asleep here.

2207
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:31.960
-Do you mind if I come over?
-Yes.

2208
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.120
Make sure I'm allowed in.
You've got my details.

2209
01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:35.000
Martin Rohde has probably identified
the second body. He's coming over.

2210
01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.170
-Is that a problem?
-Yes...

2211
01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:37.040
No, no.

2212
01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:38.530
If half of the body is Danish,
we have to cooperate.

2213
01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:39.300
I'll schedule a meeting
at half past five.

2214
01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:40.300
-Can you be ready by then?
-Yes.

2215
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:47.880
It finally worked out.

2216
01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:51.370
-What did you just sign?
-Formalities.

2217
01:10:51.970 --> 01:10:53.030
-Whose is it?
-What?

2218
01:10:53.070 --> 01:10:53.660
The heart. Whose is it?

2219
01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:54.750
A man's. He's 25 or 26
and had a motorcycle accident.

2220
01:10:55.630 --> 01:10:56.970
-What's his name?
-I don't know. Does it matter?

2221
01:10:57.660 --> 01:10:58.640
No, I guess it doesn't.

2222
01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:00.950
-I'm scared.
-It will be fine.

2223
01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:02.730
Anders will operate, they're all
highly skilled. It will be fine.

2224
01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:03.660
I can't imagine life without you.

2225
01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.160
-I need to take Göran with me.
-Don't worry. You'll make it, honey.

2226
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.920
-Hi.
-Hi.

2227
01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:08.760
-Hi! An early breakfast?
-No thank you.

2228
01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.170
-An email would have been faster.
-Yes, but not as pleasant.

2229
01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:11.930
-Where are you going?
-I'm coming in with you.

2230
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:14.160
If it really is Monique Brammer,
we both have responsibilities.

2231
01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:15.880
Go straight on,
turn left, and register.

2232
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:20.130
-Good morning. Coffee?
-No thanks, I've already had some.

2233
01:11:20.170 --> 01:11:21.500
I'm Martin Rohde.
I'll be working with Saga.

2234
01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:23.070
-Thank you. You need to register.
-I also need a card.

2235
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.860
-My name's Felicia.
-Nice to meet you.

2236
01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:25.220
-That's it. This is for you.
-Thank you.

2237
01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:26.520
-And one of these is for you.
-Thanks! Ooh, Danish.

2238
01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:28.180
-See you later.
-I hope so.

2239
01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:32.040
-Where's Saga Norén?
-To the right. Bye!

2240
01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:35.920
Excuse me.

2241
01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:36.770
-Sit down.
-I'm afraid I can't.

2242
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.290
-You make me nervous.
-OK, I can stand still.

2243
01:11:39.330 --> 01:11:40.610
-Why can't you sit down?
-My nether regions hurt.

2244
01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:42.410
-I had a vasectomy yesterday.
-Right.

2245
01:11:42.450 --> 01:11:43.280
I've got five children
with three different women.

2246
01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:44.630
-Have you got children?
-No, why would I want to?

2247
01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:45.740
-I've never heard anyone ask that.
-Many should have.

2248
01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:47.920
Not you,
I'm sure you're a wonderful dad.

2249
01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:51.600
-Why aren't you off sick?
-I can't afford it. August moved in.

2250
01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.390
Well, it's not really about money.
It was a small procedure, I can work.

2251
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:54.290
-You can't sit down.
-I can.

2252
01:11:54.330 --> 01:11:55.400
-I drove here.
-Pretend that the chair is a car.

2253
01:11:57.150 --> 01:11:57.650
Yes.

2254
01:12:00.190 --> 01:12:01.260
-No one wanted to solve the case.
-What do you mean?

2255
01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:02.140
Monique Brammer
was reported missing.

2256
01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:03.670
Two prostitutes and a neighbour were
interviewed. The case was shelved.

2257
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:04.570
It fell between two stools.

2258
01:12:04.610 --> 01:12:05.850
She disappeared, or she was killed.
They didn't find a body.

2259
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:07.000
The case was
supposed to be shelved.

2260
01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:08.220
I'm surprised it took two weeks.
Come with me.

2261
01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.620
Do you think I should?
I tried painkillers, but...

2262
01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:14.190
-Two computers?
-They know who it is now.

2263
01:12:14.230 --> 01:12:14.990
-Will Saga handle the case, Hans?
-Yes.

2264
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:15.920
-That's good.
-And a Danish police officer.

2265
01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.710
-Does he know that she's a bit odd?
-If not, he'll soon find out.

2266
01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:20.070
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

2267
01:12:20.110 --> 01:12:21.320
-This is Martin Röhde.
-It's Rohde.

2268
01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:22.620
Not as when you say "fur".
Rohde, Foure...

2269
01:12:23.490 --> 01:12:24.610
-Have you read the file?
-Most people have just arrived.

2270
01:12:24.650 --> 01:12:25.680
Half of two female bodies were found.
One was Kerstin Ekwall.

2271
01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:26.460
The other one has been deep-frozen.
Martin?

2272
01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:27.820
It's probably the 23-year-old
Monique Brammer from Copenhagen.

2273
01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:29.040
A prostitute and an addict
that went missing 13 months ago.

2274
01:12:29.690 --> 01:12:30.680
Do you want me to repeat that?
A bit slower?

2275
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:31.830
Monique Brammer, 23 years old.
A prostitute and an addict.

2276
01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:32.730
She went missing 13 months ago.

2277
01:12:32.770 --> 01:12:34.300
-Right.
-The investigation was inadequate.

2278
01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.620
-Don't you agree?
-Yes. It was terrible.

2279
01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:37.730
But we found blood traces
in her apartment.

2280
01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:39.120
The samples are on their way
and can be compared to the body.

2281
01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.350
Before the bodies were dumped,
the power was cut for 48 seconds.

2282
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:41.370
Their trying to trace the signal.
Can you help them, Gry?

2283
01:12:41.410 --> 01:12:42.390
-How was it done?
-Someone accessed a computer.

2284
01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:42.870
Can you show me the fourth picture?

2285
01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:43.910
Use all the people you need. Gry?

2286
01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:45.290
Here's Ekwall's mobile number.
Get the phone records.

2287
01:12:45.330 --> 01:12:46.430
Check her computers.
Talk to John about passwords.

2288
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:47.340
Anne?
Find out where she was abducted.

2289
01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:48.570
She left work half past six.
She had a car. Find it!

2290
01:12:48.610 --> 01:12:50.010
-Were they dumped from her car?
-No, a black Cadillac Escalade.

2291
01:12:50.050 --> 01:12:51.470
The image where the bridge
is seen from above.

2292
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:52.830
-John can find the license number.
-What? Sure.

2293
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:53.820
-What are you doing?
-I had an idea.

2294
01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:55.350
The orange line the body was on...
We discussed where she was.

2295
01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:56.200
Here's the Swedish-Danish border.

2296
01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:57.300
One half is in Sweden,
one is in Denmark.

2297
01:12:57.340 --> 01:12:58.410
-It's millimetre perfect.
-Tell me everything about the line.

2298
01:12:58.450 --> 01:12:59.040
Take paint samples.

2299
01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:00.610
Power cut, body halves, a politician.
We'll be in the public eye.

2300
01:13:09.130 --> 01:13:10.620
-Hi. Is Veronika at home?
-Yes.

2301
01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:11.510
-What do you want?
-I would like to talk to her.

2302
01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:12.750
-You can talk to me.
-I would if you were clean.

2303
01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:13.930
-What? I am clean.
-Hi, Veronika.

2304
01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:15.410
-Isn't it enough to have us evicted?
-The landlord did that.

2305
01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.320
-You're not helping.
-I'm trying. I'm trying really hard.

2306
01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:18.820
If you had been more dependable,
you wouldn't have to move.

2307
01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:21.250
-That was bloody stupid.
-Sören! Stop it!

2308
01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:23.850
What the hell?

2309
01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:26.130
Stop, you bastard!

2310
01:13:28.050 --> 01:13:28.640
Stop! Come out!

2311
01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:32.300
Sören! Stop it, Sören! Stop it!

2312
01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:33.220
-I hate that bloody bastard!
-Sören!

2313
01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:34.960
He's caused trouble all along.
It makes me so angry!

2314
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.470
Let go of me.
Go to hell, you bloody idiots.

2315
01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:47.030
-How's the operation going?
-It hasn't started.

2316
01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:48.160
-Why? He was prepared hours ago.
-I don't know.

2317
01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:48.890
I'm afraid I have to go.

2318
01:13:48.930 --> 01:13:50.420
-Don't you know where he is?
-You probably know better than me.

2319
01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:51.860
We'll call you if we hear from him...
Let's go.

2320
01:13:52.370 --> 01:13:53.590
-I'm sorry about all of this.
-Stop apologizing for him.

2321
01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:55.490
He's an adult
and makes his own decisions.

2322
01:13:55.530 --> 01:13:57.120
Maybe you should do the same?
Sören put you in this position.

2323
01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.700
You spend your money wisely,
but can't if you're not given any.

2324
01:13:59.190 --> 01:14:00.110
You don't get the chance
to care for your boys.

2325
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:01.680
-He hits you and the children.
-Hardly ever the children.

2326
01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:02.710
Hardly ever? That's not good enough.

2327
01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:03.800
He shouldn't hit any of you.

2328
01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:05.750
You can get your life back on track.
Just you and the children.

2329
01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:07.790
Leave your husband
or nothing will change.

2330
01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:09.120
Think about it.

2331
01:14:12.150 --> 01:14:13.810
-Anders? What's going on?
-We've got a problem.

2332
01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:15.280
The donor was declared brain dead,
and a nurse spoke to his father.

2333
01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:16.640
The father changed his mind.
We can't have the heart. Göran!

2334
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:23.540
Wasn't that the turn-off?

2335
01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:25.250
-Stefan? Wasn't that the turn-off?
-No, not today.

2336
01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:26.900
-Where are we going?
-You'll see.

2337
01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:35.770
Johan was nicknamed "The old bag".
He died a month ago.

2338
01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:37.640
No wife, no children, no debts,
no assets. The house was all he had.

2339
01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:38.650
It went to the local council.

2340
01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:41.900
It's Sören.

2341
01:14:43.330 --> 01:14:43.830
Come.

2342
01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:53.010
-Step inside.
-What about the children?

2343
01:14:53.050 --> 01:14:53.730
They can stay outside a while longer.

2344
01:14:55.170 --> 01:14:56.620
-Where are we? Why are we here?
-Just go inside.

2345
01:14:59.530 --> 01:15:00.980
-Crime scene and meeting place.
-Have you worked here a long time?

2346
01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:01.570
-More than ten years?
-Yes.

2347
01:15:01.610 --> 01:15:02.690
-Are you from around here?
-From Malmö? No.

2348
01:15:02.730 --> 01:15:04.450
I'm from Copenhagen.
I was born there.

2349
01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.930
No wonder Ingmar Bergman
and Lars Norén are from Sweden.

2350
01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:08.200
-Are you related to Lars Norén?
-No.

2351
01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:09.440
We need to find the meeting place
and the crime scene.

2352
01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:10.660
Where did the perpetrator
meet the victim?

2353
01:15:14.090 --> 01:15:15.320
I've spoken to Copenhagen.
You'll cooperate on the deaths.

2354
01:15:15.530 --> 01:15:16.360
Here's info about your authority.

2355
01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:17.560
I know what applies to me
in Denmark.

2356
01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:18.950
-Can I have a word with you, Saga?
-Yes.

2357
01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:21.340
The report you filed
against Martin...

2358
01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:22.010
Yes, there's only one.

2359
01:15:22.050 --> 01:15:23.020
What do you suggest I do with it?

2360
01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:24.020
Don't you think
it will affect your cooperation?

2361
01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:25.130
-Do you think so?
-I think there's every chance.

2362
01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:26.430
-Will he dislike me?
-That might happen.

2363
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:27.990
Because of my report?
It doesn't have to affect the case.

2364
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:29.030
He let an ambulance through.
No life was in danger.

2365
01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:30.040
-I'm supposed to file a report.
-I'll handle the report.

2366
01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.700
-Yes, that's fine. Fine.
-I've got the car's license number.

2367
01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:32.550
It belongs to Daniel Farbé in Malmö.

2368
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:33.460
-The journalist?
-Yes, he's a journalist.

2369
01:15:35.410 --> 01:15:36.690
-Do you know who he is?
-Yes. I read his column.

2370
01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:37.980
It's entertaining.

2371
01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:52.880
-You made me jump.
-I worked all night.

2372
01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.110
-I'm done for the week. Berlin next.
-You work all night.

2373
01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:55.010
Then you get down in Berlin.
How do you manage?

2374
01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:56.180
Get down?
How many children have you got?

2375
01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:57.100
Children that suck the life
out of you.

2376
01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:58.790
I haven't got children. No one says
"get down" any more. No one.

2377
01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:00.080
-Have fun.
-I will.

2378
01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:00.790
I downloaded
"Elephants in the Desert".

2379
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.860
What do you want, Åke?

2380
01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:02.960
A hug, an award, an applause?
Would you like one?

2381
01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:04.700
-They're really cool. I like them.
-Yes, they were cool.

2382
01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:06.130
What?
Two weeks ago you really liked them.

2383
01:16:06.170 --> 01:16:06.720
And now you like them.

2384
01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:07.790
My daughter...

2385
01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:09.910
-She danced all afternoon.
-Sorry, I have to answer.

2386
01:16:10.450 --> 01:16:11.290
We'll have to continue this later.

2387
01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.010
You and the boys will disappear.

2388
01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:14.910
Your paperwork
and your debts are gone.

2389
01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:16.650
You can make a fresh start.
Do you understand?

2390
01:16:17.090 --> 01:16:18.840
You can make a fresh start.
There's cash and a mobile here.

2391
01:16:19.330 --> 01:16:20.520
But you can never see or talk to
your husband again.

2392
01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:22.120
He's their dad.
I have to let them see him.

2393
01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:23.200
Why? Why do they have to?

2394
01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:25.440
To get another beating?
To be scared and broke?

2395
01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.000
Let him spend everything on drugs?
He'll ruin everything for you again.

2396
01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:28.060
People like him ruin things.

2397
01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:29.730
You don't know me.
Why are you doing this?

2398
01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:32.790
Because I can.

2399
01:16:44.250 --> 01:16:44.750
Bloody hell.

2400
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:53.820
-Here's my car.
-Do you think it's him?

2401
01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:55.080
He kept a body in a freezer
and killed a politician.

2402
01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.170
-He wouldn't use his own car.
-Nice car.

2403
01:16:56.210 --> 01:16:57.470
-Is the Swedish police paid well?
-No, the same as in Denmark.

2404
01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:58.900
Don't jump to conclusions
about my wages based on my car.

2405
01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:00.190
Maybe it was a gift?
Maybe I inherited it or had savings?

2406
01:17:00.230 --> 01:17:01.460
I hope your professional conclusions
are more valid.

2407
01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:02.750
Read this.
It's Daniel Ferbé's latest column.

2408
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:04.040
-The one that's a good writer?
-No, I said he's entertaining.

2409
01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:04.710
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

2410
01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:18.440
Hello? What's going on?

2411
01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:19.790
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-A Cadillac has a bomb in it.

2412
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:20.830
Is it a black Escalade?
It's tied to a double homicide.

2413
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:22.360
-Is the guy trying to kill himself?
-I don't think he was involved.

2414
01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:23.690
No, you're not going
anywhere near the place.

2415
01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:32.210
Help! Help!

2416
01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:33.100
-Take it easy.
-Please help me!

2417
01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:34.260
-Help me! Get me out!
-Calm down.

2418
01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:36.800
-Help me!
-The windshield is wired in.

2419
01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:37.790
The side windows are
connected to the electrical system.

2420
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:39.220
The glass seems OK,
but there are wires everywhere.

2421
01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:41.860
We've got his contact details.

2422
01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:47.150
-What's going on?
-My mobile!

2423
01:17:47.190 --> 01:17:48.390
-Yes?
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

2424
01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:49.800
I need to know whether you were
on the bridge last night.

2425
01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:50.900
-What?
-Were you on the Öresund Bridge?

2426
01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:52.010
I was working.
I was here all the time.

2427
01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:53.380
-How will you get me out?
-I don't know, that's not my job.

2428
01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:54.490
-Do you know Kerstin Ekwall?
-Who?

2429
01:17:54.530 --> 01:17:55.420
Daniel? Did you do anything
apart from turn the key?

2430
01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:56.800
No. Everything locked.
The countdown started.

2431
01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:57.630
-Hello?
-I'm talking to the bomb guy.

2432
01:17:57.670 --> 01:17:58.440
Chairman of the City Council
Kerstin Ekwall.

2433
01:17:58.480 --> 01:17:59.930
-Have you written about her?
-No, I don't know.

2434
01:17:59.970 --> 01:18:01.050
-Have you been tipped off about her?
-No! What is this?

2435
01:18:01.090 --> 01:18:01.750
Get me out! Please!

2436
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:02.910
Does anyone else
have a key to your car?

2437
01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:04.350
-No, I don't know.
-Can you reach it?

2438
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:05.270
I don't want to die. Please.

2439
01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:06.590
-I don't want it to end like this.
-Daniel? You need to talk to me.

2440
01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:09.170
It skipped a minute.
What the hell did you do?

2441
01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:10.960
It was three, now it's two.
It was three.

2442
01:18:11.450 --> 01:18:12.380
Come one, hurry up.

2443
01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:13.680
Where are you going?
Stay here! Please!

2444
01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:15.870
Please! Come back!
Where are you going?

2445
01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:20.520
You need to talk to me.
Daniel? Daniel?

2446
01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:21.490
Is it a big bomb?

2447
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:23.590
-I think so.
-You're not religious, right?

2448
01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:24.300
You're an atheist?

2449
01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:25.860
Everything will just stop. The body
won't have time to register pain.

2450
01:18:26.970 --> 01:18:28.390
-Are you sure?
-Don't look at the clock. Listen.

2451
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:29.830
Do you know why your car
was used to dump two bodies?

2452
01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:31.320
-No.
-Think about it. Focus.

2453
01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:32.740
-Who did this to you?
-I've slagged so many people off.

2454
01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:36.960
Daniel? Are you still there? Hello?

2455
01:18:43.810 --> 01:18:44.330
It's clean.

2456
01:18:46.230 --> 01:18:47.390
Sorry about the drama, it's hard
to make oneself heard today.

2457
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:48.210
I assume I have your attention now.

2458
01:18:48.250 --> 01:18:49.850
Our part of the world would be
wonderful if we solved our problems.

2459
01:18:49.890 --> 01:18:50.720
I would like to
point out five in particular.

2460
01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.380
This is only a beginning. We've got
interesting times ahead of us.

2461
01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:53.280
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-Copenhagen Police.

2462
01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.010
-Do you know who she is?
-Yes.

2463
01:18:54.290 --> 01:18:55.970
Excuse me. A woman insists on
speaking to the person in charge.

2464
01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:57.510
-Is she in Sweden or Denmark?
-I don't know.

2465
01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:59.180
She's Swedish, and the car came
from Sweden. I assume I'm in charge.

2466
01:19:00.570 --> 01:19:01.710
-Saga Norén. Can I help you?
-When will you let traffic through?

2467
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:02.810
-It might take up to two hours.
-I haven't got two hours!

2468
01:19:02.850 --> 01:19:03.610
-Back up.
-Is someone's life in danger?

2469
01:19:03.650 --> 01:19:04.420
There's a heart for my husband
in Copenhagen.

2470
01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:05.540
He needs a heart transplant.
Let us through.

2471
01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:06.530
He'll have to wait.
I can't let anyone through.

2472
01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:08.020
-What's happened?
-Is there no other way through?

2473
01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:09.060
There ought to be
another way through.

2474
01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:10.550
-No one's answering any questions.
-Let me pass, please.

2475
01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.390
The Öresund Bridge to Denmark
is closed.

2476
01:19:14.430 --> 01:19:15.310
According to the police it will...

2477
01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:21.230
-It's Stefan Lindberg.
-Hi, it's Veronika.

2478
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:22.650
-Sorry, did I wake you up?
-No, you didn't. How are you?

2479
01:19:22.690 --> 01:19:23.880
I can't sleep.
I've got a stomach ache.

2480
01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:24.980
-I see. How are the boys?
-They're asleep.

2481
01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:26.060
They don't understand
what's about to happen.

2482
01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:27.380
-Can we meet up?
-Now?

2483
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:28.850
Of course.
Do you want me to come over?

2484
01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:30.690
-No. I'd rather go to your place.
-OK.

2485
01:19:30.730 --> 01:19:31.670
-I can go to the office.
-I'll see you there.

2486
01:19:34.290 --> 01:19:35.320
Give me everything from
when the car came on to the bridge.

2487
01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:36.590
One camera records at a time.
They're started manually.

2488
01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:37.490
My colleague
might have recorded something.

2489
01:19:37.530 --> 01:19:38.560
Hello! Stop! Stop!

2490
01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:39.940
-Stop! Stop!
-I allowed it.

2491
01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:41.250
-Why? This is a crime scene.
-I'm fully aware of that.

2492
01:19:41.290 --> 01:19:42.040
-We've got enough bodies.
-He wasn't dying.

2493
01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:43.100
-Are you a doctor?
-No, I'm a police officer.

2494
01:19:43.690 --> 01:19:44.860
-What's your name?
-Martin Rohde.

2495
01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:45.800
-Rohde?
-R, O, H, D, E.

2496
01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:47.520
-Have you got an ID?
-It was an ambulance.

2497
01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:48.750
The Chairman
of Malmö City Council is dead.

2498
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:50.090
-What evidence was destroyed?
-Probably none.

2499
01:19:50.130 --> 01:19:50.640
Thank you.

2500
01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:57.930
Hello. Hi. Finally.

2501
01:19:57.970 --> 01:19:59.380
I wont operate on Göran, Charlotte.
I had wine with my dinner.

2502
01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:01.270
-At what time? Are you drunk?
-No, but that doesn't matter.

2503
01:20:01.610 --> 01:20:02.590
You promised to see us through this.

2504
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:03.710
-Morten Krag is a very good surgeon.
-Better than you?

2505
01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:04.620
I'll decide
who my husband's surgeon is!

2506
01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:06.130
-I wont forgive you if it goes wrong.
-What if I do it and it goes wrong?

2507
01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:07.690
Then I'll never forgive myself.

2508
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:12.800
-We're done, you can move her.
-You can take her away.

2509
01:20:14.890 --> 01:20:15.420
Bloody hell.

2510
01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:20.910
The autopsy on Kerstin Ekwall
is being performed.

2511
01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:21.870
-And the recordings?
-They'll deliver them tomorrow.

2512
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:22.670
-What about the press?
-They know.

2513
01:20:22.710 --> 01:20:23.770
The radio said that it was a woman.
They don't know who it is.

2514
01:20:23.810 --> 01:20:25.090
-And the family?
-I'm on my way to see them.

2515
01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:26.620
You'll wake them up, and there
are children there. Tread lightly.

2516
01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:28.210
In what sense? Oh. There aren't
that many ways to say it.

2517
01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:29.010
-Just tread lightly.
-Listen, Hans...

2518
01:20:29.050 --> 01:20:29.750
She was chopped in half.

2519
01:20:29.790 --> 01:20:30.860
-Right above the hips.
-What the hell are you saying?

2520
01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:32.940
She was due to attend a conference
in Copenhagen this morning.

2521
01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:34.300
-Have you got more computers?
-No.

2522
01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:35.230
Are you taking them?
The children's as well?

2523
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:36.410
-When did you last talk to her?
-She called yesterday.

2524
01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:37.460
-Do you know what time it was?
-I don't know.

2525
01:20:37.690 --> 01:20:38.530
Around half past six in the evening.

2526
01:20:38.570 --> 01:20:39.370
-Was she threatened?
-By whom?

2527
01:20:39.410 --> 01:20:40.180
I didn't say that she was,
I asked you.

2528
01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:42.120
Not really. She was a politician,
there were some calls and emails.

2529
01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:43.610
-Has she upset anyone lately?
-Lately...

2530
01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:44.850
She wanted to charge for
library loans. Some disapproved.

2531
01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:45.870
-That's foolish.
-Sorry, what?

2532
01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:47.510
Reading becomes a money matter.
Social differences will grow.

2533
01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:48.470
-Is that why she was...?
-We don't know why.

2534
01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:49.250
It's unlikely
that library fees caused it.

2535
01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:50.500
Why? Why did someone do this?

2536
01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:52.190
Can you think of something personal?
Was she in debt? Did she use drugs?

2537
01:20:52.230 --> 01:20:52.960
Did she have an affair?

2538
01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:57.370
Saga Norén.

2539
01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:58.440
Can't we talk on the phone?

2540
01:20:58.980 --> 01:20:59.910
I'll be there in twenty minutes. Bye.

2541
01:21:11.330 --> 01:21:11.830
August?

2542
01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:25.670
-Were you on the bridge?
-Yes.

2543
01:21:25.710 --> 01:21:26.730
-What happened?
-A murder, the Swedes will handle it.

2544
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:27.580
-Did you check on August?
-Yes.

2545
01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:28.500
-Is he asleep?
-Yes.

2546
01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:29.610
You promised to talk to him.
He's become a night owl.

2547
01:21:29.650 --> 01:21:30.420
Do you want me to
wake him up now?

2548
01:21:30.710 --> 01:21:32.050
-He got up at three o'clock today.
-I'll have a word with him tomorrow.

2549
01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:36.170
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

2550
01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:43.410
-Do you know the cause of death?
-I can make a qualified guess.

2551
01:21:43.450 --> 01:21:44.390
She died six to eight hours ago.

2552
01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:45.680
Yes, she called home at six thirty
and was dumped just after midnight.

2553
01:21:46.090 --> 01:21:46.900
There's something else.

2554
01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:47.580
-What?
-Take a look.

2555
01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.360
No livor mortis on the ears.
That's consistent with the bleeding.

2556
01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:57.110
Petechiae on the conjunctivas.

2557
01:21:57.890 --> 01:21:58.490
The face is swollen.

2558
01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:00.570
She was strangled
and cut in half after death.

2559
01:22:00.810 --> 01:22:01.370
And the other half?

2560
01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:03.990
The lower body is much paler.
A lot paler.

2561
01:22:04.650 --> 01:22:05.850
It's not coherent with the bleeding
or how the body was placed.

2562
01:22:06.970 --> 01:22:08.070
There's brown discoloration.
Frostbite?

2563
01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:09.490
It feels different. Frostbite.

2564
01:22:09.530 --> 01:22:10.250
Not frostbite, deep-freezing.

2565
01:22:10.290 --> 01:22:11.480
For about a year, I think.
I've never seen anything like this.

2566
01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:12.770
I don't know who they belong to.
They're not Kerstin Ekwall's legs.

2567
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:19.350
-So everyone's here, then.
-Yes.

2568
01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:19.890
Hi, Sebastian.

2569
01:22:21.130 --> 01:22:21.710
I don't know what to do.

2570
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:22.790
I'm worried about tomorrow.
I had to see you.

2571
01:22:22.830 --> 01:22:23.600
Can't you just pay the rent?

2572
01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:25.080
They can't evict the children.
Can they? Their friends are there.

2573
01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:25.920
I paid out money for the rent.

2574
01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:27.470
-Why did you bring the children?
-Sören wasn't there.

2575
01:22:27.890 --> 01:22:28.480
I can't manage.

2576
01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:29.890
-Can't you make an exception?
-No. You know I can't.

2577
01:22:29.930 --> 01:22:30.900
-Please.
-There are guidelines. I'm sorry.

2578
01:22:35.070 --> 01:22:36.350
Charlotte Söringer? I'm Frederik
Henriksen, hospital administrator.

2579
01:22:36.930 --> 01:22:38.230
-Göran had atrial fibrillation.
-They managed to stop it.

2580
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:39.310
-He's to weak for surgery.
-Too weak?

2581
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:40.530
-But there's a new heart.
-It will be given to someone else.

2582
01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:41.870
Anders said
that you need a new CT scanner.

2583
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:43.490
My husband's business is doing well.
He's willing to donate a CT scanner.

2584
01:22:43.530 --> 01:22:44.300
We're cancelling for his own sake.

2585
01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:45.660
He'll die without a new heart.
I want both parties to benefit.

2586
01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:47.340
Pass my offer on
to the proper authority, please.

2587
01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:53.680
-Hello? Is this Martin Rohde?
-Yes.

2588
01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:54.850
-It's Saga Norén from the bridge.
-Yes, I remember.

2589
01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:56.540
-Were you asleep?
-I tend to doze off around this time.

2590
01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:57.430
-There were two women.
-You found another one.

2591
01:22:57.470 --> 01:22:58.400
The lower body
belonged to someone else.

2592
01:22:58.440 --> 01:22:59.700
-Have you found half a body?
-I don't know.

2593
01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:01.230
It could be more than a year ago.
The legs have been deep-frozen.

2594
01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:02.430
-Can you look into it? Now?
-First thing tomorrow morning.

2595
01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:03.650
Can someone else
look into it straight away?

2596
01:23:04.450 --> 01:23:05.380
-I'll call you back.
-When?

2597
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:07.910
-Do you have to get up?
-Yes.

2598
01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:15.910
Missing woman, Caucasian,
at least a year ago...

2599
01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:16.610
-How old?
-Adult.

2600
01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:17.650
-And life in general is OK?
-Yes.

2601
01:23:17.690 --> 01:23:18.370
-What about you?
-I'm fine.

2602
01:23:18.850 --> 01:23:20.190
-So you'll be firing blanks.
-Was it in the staff news bulletin?

2603
01:23:20.230 --> 01:23:21.630
-Is everything working as it should?
-It will in time.

2604
01:23:21.670 --> 01:23:22.310
It can't be much fun.

2605
01:23:22.350 --> 01:23:23.540
-What do you mean?
-You've heard about castrated toms?

2606
01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:25.240
A wild predator turns into
a chunky sleepyhead. Just like that.

2607
01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:27.130
They're castrated,
that's not the same thing.

2608
01:23:27.610 --> 01:23:28.300
Let's see what we've got.

2609
01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:29.600
Two women killed a year apart.

2610
01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:30.850
One was deep-frozen.
They were dismembered.

2611
01:23:30.890 --> 01:23:32.510
And assembled on the bridge.
Someone wants to make a statement.

2612
01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:35.280
-Saga Norén.
-It's Martin.

2613
01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:36.780
The lower body is Monique Brammer,
I think. A missing 23-year-old.

2614
01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:37.590
-Can you email the info?
-I'll be right over.

2615
01:23:37.630 --> 01:23:38.610
-Why do you want to come here?
-She's Danish.

2616
01:23:38.650 --> 01:23:39.820
I was first on the scene.
Everyone's still asleep here.

2617
01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:40.690
-Do you mind if I come over?
-Yes.

2618
01:23:40.730 --> 01:23:41.850
Make sure I'm allowed in.
You've got my details.

2619
01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:43.730
Martin Rohde has probably identified
the second body. He's coming over.

2620
01:23:43.770 --> 01:23:44.900
-Is that a problem?
-Yes...

2621
01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:45.770
No, no.

2622
01:23:45.810 --> 01:23:47.260
If half of the body is Danish,
we have to cooperate.

2623
01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:48.030
I'll schedule a meeting
at half past five.

2624
01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:49.030
-Can you be ready by then?
-Yes.

2625
01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:56.610
It finally worked out.

2626
01:23:58.530 --> 01:24:00.100
-What did you just sign?
-Formalities.

2627
01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:01.760
-Whose is it?
-What?

2628
01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:02.390
The heart. Whose is it?

2629
01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:03.480
A man's. He's 25 or 26
and had a motorcycle accident.

2630
01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:05.700
-What's his name?
-I don't know. Does it matter?

2631
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:07.370
No, I guess it doesn't.

2632
01:24:08.330 --> 01:24:09.680
-I'm scared.
-It will be fine.

2633
01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:11.460
Anders will operate, they're all
highly skilled. It will be fine.

2634
01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:12.390
I can't imagine life without you.

2635
01:24:13.210 --> 01:24:14.890
-I need to take Göran with me.
-Don't worry. You'll make it, honey.

2636
01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:16.650
-Hi.
-Hi.

2637
01:24:16.690 --> 01:24:17.490
-Hi! An early breakfast?
-No thank you.

2638
01:24:17.530 --> 01:24:18.900
-An email would have been faster.
-Yes, but not as pleasant.

2639
01:24:19.570 --> 01:24:20.660
-Where are you going?
-I'm coming in with you.

2640
01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:22.890
If it really is Monique Brammer,
we both have responsibilities.

2641
01:24:23.690 --> 01:24:24.610
Go straight on,
turn left, and register.

2642
01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:28.860
-Good morning. Coffee?
-No thanks, I've already had some.

2643
01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:30.230
I'm Martin Rohde.
I'll be working with Saga.

2644
01:24:30.270 --> 01:24:31.800
-Thank you. You need to register.
-I also need a card.

2645
01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:32.590
-My name's Felicia.
-Nice to meet you.

2646
01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:33.950
-That's it. This is for you.
-Thank you.

2647
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:35.250
-And one of these is for you.
-Thanks! Ooh, Danish.

2648
01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:36.910
-See you later.
-I hope so.

2649
01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:40.770
-Where's Saga Norén?
-To the right. Bye!

2650
01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:44.650
Excuse me.

2651
01:24:44.690 --> 01:24:45.500
-Sit down.
-I'm afraid I can't.

2652
01:24:46.730 --> 01:24:48.020
-You make me nervous.
-OK, I can stand still.

2653
01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:49.340
-Why can't you sit down?
-My nether regions hurt.

2654
01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:51.140
-I had a vasectomy yesterday.
-Right.

2655
01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:52.010
I've got five children
with three different women.

2656
01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:53.360
-Have you got children?
-No, why would I want to?

2657
01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:54.470
-I've never heard anyone ask that.
-Many should have.

2658
01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:56.650
Not you,
I'm sure you're a wonderful dad.

2659
01:24:59.030 --> 01:25:00.330
-Why aren't you off sick?
-I can't afford it. August moved in.

2660
01:25:00.370 --> 01:25:02.120
Well, it's not really about money.
It was a small procedure, I can work.

2661
01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:03.020
-You can't sit down.
-I can.

2662
01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:04.130
-I drove here.
-Pretend that the chair is a car.

2663
01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:06.380
Yes.

2664
01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:09.990
-No one wanted to solve the case.
-What do you mean?

2665
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:10.870
Monique Brammer
was reported missing.

2666
01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:12.400
Two prostitutes and a neighbour were
interviewed. The case was shelved.

2667
01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:13.300
It fell between two stools.

2668
01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:14.580
She disappeared, or she was killed.
They didn't find a body.

2669
01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:15.730
The case was
supposed to be shelved.

2670
01:25:15.770 --> 01:25:16.950
I'm surprised it took two weeks.
Come with me.

2671
01:25:20.250 --> 01:25:21.350
Do you think I should?
I tried painkillers, but...

2672
01:25:22.110 --> 01:25:22.920
-Two computers?
-They know who it is now.

2673
01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:23.720
-Will Saga handle the case, Hans?
-Yes.

2674
01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:24.650
-That's good.
-And a Danish police officer.

2675
01:25:24.690 --> 01:25:26.440
-Does he know that she's a bit odd?
-If not, he'll soon find out.

2676
01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:28.800
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

2677
01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:30.050
-This is Martin Röhde.
-It's Rohde.

2678
01:25:30.090 --> 01:25:31.350
Not as when you say "fur".
Rohde, Foure...

2679
01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:33.340
-Have you read the file?
-Most people have just arrived.

2680
01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:34.410
Half of two female bodies were found.
One was Kerstin Ekwall.

2681
01:25:34.450 --> 01:25:35.190
The other one has been deep-frozen.
Martin?

2682
01:25:35.230 --> 01:25:36.550
It's probably the 23-year-old
Monique Brammer from Copenhagen.

2683
01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:37.770
A prostitute and an addict
that went missing 13 months ago.

2684
01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:39.410
Do you want me to repeat that?
A bit slower?

2685
01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:40.560
Monique Brammer, 23 years old.
A prostitute and an addict.

2686
01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:41.460
She went missing 13 months ago.

2687
01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:43.030
-Right.
-The investigation was inadequate.

2688
01:25:43.850 --> 01:25:45.350
-Don't you agree?
-Yes. It was terrible.

2689
01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:46.460
But we found blood traces
in her apartment.

2690
01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:47.850
The samples are on their way
and can be compared to the body.

2691
01:25:47.890 --> 01:25:49.080
Before the bodies were dumped,
the power was cut for 48 seconds.

2692
01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:50.100
Their trying to trace the signal.
Can you help them, Gry?

2693
01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:51.120
-How was it done?
-Someone accessed a computer.

2694
01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:51.600
Can you show me the fourth picture?

2695
01:25:52.030 --> 01:25:52.640
Use all the people you need. Gry?

2696
01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:54.020
Here's Ekwall's mobile number.
Get the phone records.

2697
01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:55.160
Check her computers.
Talk to John about passwords.

2698
01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:56.070
Anne?
Find out where she was abducted.

2699
01:25:56.110 --> 01:25:57.300
She left work half past six.
She had a car. Find it!

2700
01:25:57.340 --> 01:25:58.740
-Were they dumped from her car?
-No, a black Cadillac Escalade.

2701
01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:00.200
The image where the bridge
is seen from above.

2702
01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:01.560
-John can find the license number.
-What? Sure.

2703
01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:02.550
-What are you doing?
-I had an idea.

2704
01:26:02.590 --> 01:26:04.080
The orange line the body was on...
We discussed where she was.

2705
01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:04.930
Here's the Swedish-Danish border.

2706
01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:06.030
One half is in Sweden,
one is in Denmark.

2707
01:26:06.070 --> 01:26:07.140
-It's millimetre perfect.
-Tell me everything about the line.

2708
01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:07.770
Take paint samples.

2709
01:26:07.810 --> 01:26:09.340
Power cut, body halves, a politician.
We'll be in the public eye.

2710
01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:19.350
-Hi. Is Veronika at home?
-Yes.

2711
01:26:19.390 --> 01:26:20.240
-What do you want?
-I would like to talk to her.

2712
01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.480
-You can talk to me.
-I would if you were clean.

2713
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:22.660
-What? I am clean.
-Hi, Veronika.

2714
01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:24.140
-Isn't it enough to have us evicted?
-The landlord did that.

2715
01:26:24.570 --> 01:26:26.050
-You're not helping.
-I'm trying. I'm trying really hard.

2716
01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:27.550
If you had been more dependable,
you wouldn't have to move.

2717
01:26:28.530 --> 01:26:29.980
-That was bloody stupid.
-Sören! Stop it!

2718
01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:32.580
What the hell?

2719
01:26:34.130 --> 01:26:34.860
Stop, you bastard!

2720
01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:37.370
Stop! Come out!

2721
01:26:40.190 --> 01:26:41.030
Sören! Stop it, Sören! Stop it!

2722
01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:41.950
-I hate that bloody bastard!
-Sören!

2723
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:43.690
He's caused trouble all along.
It makes me so angry!

2724
01:26:43.730 --> 01:26:45.200
Let go of me.
Go to hell, you bloody idiots.

2725
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:55.760
-How's the operation going?
-It hasn't started.

2726
01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:56.890
-Why? He was prepared hours ago.
-I don't know.

2727
01:26:56.930 --> 01:26:57.620
I'm afraid I have to go.

2728
01:26:57.660 --> 01:26:59.150
-Don't you know where he is?
-You probably know better than me.

2729
01:26:59.190 --> 01:27:00.590
We'll call you if we hear from him...
Let's go.

2730
01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:02.320
-I'm sorry about all of this.
-Stop apologizing for him.

2731
01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:04.220
He's an adult
and makes his own decisions.

2732
01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:05.850
Maybe you should do the same?
Sören put you in this position.

2733
01:27:06.130 --> 01:27:07.430
You spend your money wisely,
but can't if you're not given any.

2734
01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:08.840
You don't get the chance
to care for your boys.

2735
01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:10.410
-He hits you and the children.
-Hardly ever the children.

2736
01:27:10.450 --> 01:27:11.440
Hardly ever? That's not good enough.

2737
01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:12.530
He shouldn't hit any of you.

2738
01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:14.480
You can get your life back on track.
Just you and the children.

2739
01:27:15.650 --> 01:27:16.520
Leave your husband
or nothing will change.

2740
01:27:17.290 --> 01:27:17.850
Think about it.

2741
01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:22.540
-Anders? What's going on?
-We've got a problem.

2742
01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:24.010
The donor was declared brain dead,
and a nurse spoke to his father.

2743
01:27:24.050 --> 01:27:25.370
The father changed his mind.
We can't have the heart. Göran!

2744
01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:32.270
Wasn't that the turn-off?

2745
01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:33.980
-Stefan? Wasn't that the turn-off?
-No, not today.

2746
01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:35.630
-Where are we going?
-You'll see.

2747
01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:44.500
Johan was nicknamed "The old bag".
He died a month ago.

2748
01:27:44.770 --> 01:27:46.370
No wife, no children, no debts,
no assets. The house was all he had.

2749
01:27:46.670 --> 01:27:47.380
It went to the local council.

2750
01:27:50.130 --> 01:27:50.630
It's Sören.

2751
01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:52.560
Come.

2752
01:28:00.610 --> 01:28:01.740
-Step inside.
-What about the children?

2753
01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:02.460
They can stay outside a while longer.

2754
01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:05.350
-Where are we? Why are we here?
-Just go inside.

2755
01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:09.710
-Crime scene and meeting place.
-Have you worked here a long time?

2756
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:10.300
-More than ten years?
-Yes.

2757
01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:11.420
-Are you from around here?
-From Malmö? No.

2758
01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:13.180
I'm from Copenhagen.
I was born there.

2759
01:28:13.770 --> 01:28:15.660
No wonder Ingmar Bergman
and Lars Norén are from Sweden.

2760
01:28:15.870 --> 01:28:16.930
-Are you related to Lars Norén?
-No.

2761
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:18.170
We need to find the meeting place
and the crime scene.

2762
01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:19.390
Where did the perpetrator
meet the victim?

2763
01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:24.050
I've spoken to Copenhagen.
You'll cooperate on the deaths.

2764
01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:25.090
Here's info about your authority.

2765
01:28:25.130 --> 01:28:26.290
I know what applies to me
in Denmark.

2766
01:28:26.930 --> 01:28:27.680
-Can I have a word with you, Saga?
-Yes.

2767
01:28:29.150 --> 01:28:30.070
The report you filed
against Martin...

2768
01:28:30.110 --> 01:28:30.740
Yes, there's only one.

2769
01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:31.750
What do you suggest I do with it?

2770
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:32.750
Don't you think
it will affect your cooperation?

2771
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:33.860
-Do you think so?
-I think there's every chance.

2772
01:28:34.050 --> 01:28:35.160
-Will he dislike me?
-That might happen.

2773
01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.720
Because of my report?
It doesn't have to affect the case.

2774
01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:37.760
He let an ambulance through.
No life was in danger.

2775
01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:38.770
-I'm supposed to file a report.
-I'll handle the report.

2776
01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:40.430
-Yes, that's fine. Fine.
-I've got the car's license number.

2777
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:41.280
It belongs to Daniel Farbé in Malmö.

2778
01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:42.190
-The journalist?
-Yes, he's a journalist.

2779
01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:45.420
-Do you know who he is?
-Yes. I read his column.

2780
01:28:46.150 --> 01:28:46.710
It's entertaining.

2781
01:29:00.210 --> 01:29:01.610
-You made me jump.
-I worked all night.

2782
01:29:01.650 --> 01:29:02.840
-I'm done for the week. Berlin next.
-You work all night.

2783
01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:03.740
Then you get down in Berlin.
How do you manage?

2784
01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:04.910
Get down?
How many children have you got?

2785
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:05.830
Children that suck the life
out of you.

2786
01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:07.520
I haven't got children. No one says
"get down" any more. No one.

2787
01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:08.810
-Have fun.
-I will.

2788
01:29:08.850 --> 01:29:09.520
I downloaded
"Elephants in the Desert".

2789
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:10.590
What do you want, Åke?

2790
01:29:10.630 --> 01:29:11.690
A hug, an award, an applause?
Would you like one?

2791
01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:13.430
-They're really cool. I like them.
-Yes, they were cool.

2792
01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:14.860
What?
Two weeks ago you really liked them.

2793
01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:15.450
And now you like them.

2794
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:16.520
My daughter...

2795
01:29:17.670 --> 01:29:18.640
-She danced all afternoon.
-Sorry, I have to answer.

2796
01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:20.020
We'll have to continue this later.

2797
01:29:21.890 --> 01:29:22.740
You and the boys will disappear.

2798
01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:23.640
Your paperwork
and your debts are gone.

2799
01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:25.380
You can make a fresh start.
Do you understand?

2800
01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:27.570
You can make a fresh start.
There's cash and a mobile here.

2801
01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:29.250
But you can never see or talk to
your husband again.

2802
01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:30.850
He's their dad.
I have to let them see him.

2803
01:29:30.890 --> 01:29:31.930
Why? Why do they have to?

2804
01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.170
To get another beating?
To be scared and broke?

2805
01:29:34.210 --> 01:29:35.730
Let him spend everything on drugs?
He'll ruin everything for you again.

2806
01:29:36.090 --> 01:29:36.790
People like him ruin things.

2807
01:29:37.530 --> 01:29:38.460
You don't know me.
Why are you doing this?

2808
01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:41.520
Because I can.

2809
01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:53.480
Bloody hell.

2810
01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:02.550
-Here's my car.
-Do you think it's him?

2811
01:30:02.590 --> 01:30:03.810
He kept a body in a freezer
and killed a politician.

2812
01:30:03.850 --> 01:30:04.900
-He wouldn't use his own car.
-Nice car.

2813
01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:06.200
-Is the Swedish police paid well?
-No, the same as in Denmark.

2814
01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:07.630
Don't jump to conclusions
about my wages based on my car.

2815
01:30:07.670 --> 01:30:08.920
Maybe it was a gift?
Maybe I inherited it or had savings?

2816
01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:10.190
I hope your professional conclusions
are more valid.

2817
01:30:10.230 --> 01:30:11.480
Read this.
It's Daniel Ferbé's latest column.

2818
01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:12.770
-The one that's a good writer?
-No, I said he's entertaining.

2819
01:30:12.810 --> 01:30:13.440
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

2820
01:30:26.010 --> 01:30:27.170
Hello? What's going on?

2821
01:30:27.210 --> 01:30:28.520
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-A Cadillac has a bomb in it.

2822
01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:29.560
Is it a black Escalade?
It's tied to a double homicide.

2823
01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:31.090
-Is the guy trying to kill himself?
-I don't think he was involved.

2824
01:30:31.130 --> 01:30:32.420
No, you're not going
anywhere near the place.

2825
01:30:39.930 --> 01:30:40.940
Help! Help!

2826
01:30:41.130 --> 01:30:41.830
-Take it easy.
-Please help me!

2827
01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:42.990
-Help me! Get me out!
-Calm down.

2828
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:45.530
-Help me!
-The windshield is wired in.

2829
01:30:45.570 --> 01:30:46.520
The side windows are
connected to the electrical system.

2830
01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:47.950
The glass seems OK,
but there are wires everywhere.

2831
01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:50.590
We've got his contact details.

2832
01:30:54.930 --> 01:30:55.880
-What's going on?
-My mobile!

2833
01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:57.120
-Yes?
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

2834
01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:58.530
I need to know whether you were
on the bridge last night.

2835
01:30:58.820 --> 01:30:59.630
-What?
-Were you on the Öresund Bridge?

2836
01:30:59.670 --> 01:31:00.740
I was working.
I was here all the time.

2837
01:31:01.110 --> 01:31:02.110
-How will you get me out?
-I don't know, that's not my job.

2838
01:31:02.150 --> 01:31:03.220
-Do you know Kerstin Ekwall?
-Who?

2839
01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:04.150
Daniel? Did you do anything
apart from turn the key?

2840
01:31:04.190 --> 01:31:05.530
No. Everything locked.
The countdown started.

2841
01:31:05.570 --> 01:31:06.360
-Hello?
-I'm talking to the bomb guy.

2842
01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:07.170
Chairman of the City Council
Kerstin Ekwall.

2843
01:31:07.210 --> 01:31:08.660
-Have you written about her?
-No, I don't know.

2844
01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:09.780
-Have you been tipped off about her?
-No! What is this?

2845
01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:10.480
Get me out! Please!

2846
01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:11.640
Does anyone else
have a key to your car?

2847
01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:13.080
-No, I don't know.
-Can you reach it?

2848
01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:14.000
I don't want to die. Please.

2849
01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:15.320
-I don't want it to end like this.
-Daniel? You need to talk to me.

2850
01:31:16.510 --> 01:31:17.900
It skipped a minute.
What the hell did you do?

2851
01:31:18.110 --> 01:31:19.690
It was three, now it's two.
It was three.

2852
01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:21.110
Come one, hurry up.

2853
01:31:21.150 --> 01:31:22.410
Where are you going?
Stay here! Please!

2854
01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:24.600
Please! Come back!
Where are you going?

2855
01:31:27.870 --> 01:31:29.250
You need to talk to me.
Daniel? Daniel?

2856
01:31:29.660 --> 01:31:30.220
Is it a big bomb?

2857
01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:32.320
-I think so.
-You're not religious, right?

2858
01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:33.030
You're an atheist?

2859
01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:34.590
Everything will just stop. The body
won't have time to register pain.

2860
01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:37.120
-Are you sure?
-Don't look at the clock. Listen.

2861
01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:38.560
Do you know why your car
was used to dump two bodies?

2862
01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:40.050
-No.
-Think about it. Focus.

2863
01:31:40.090 --> 01:31:41.470
-Who did this to you?
-I've slagged so many people off.

2864
01:31:44.630 --> 01:31:45.690
Daniel? Are you still there? Hello?

2865
01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:53.060
It's clean.

2866
01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:56.120
Sorry about the drama, it's hard
to make oneself heard today.

2867
01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:56.940
I assume I have your attention now.

2868
01:31:56.980 --> 01:31:58.580
Our part of the world would be
wonderful if we solved our problems.

2869
01:31:58.620 --> 01:31:59.450
I would like to
point out five in particular.

2870
01:31:59.490 --> 01:32:01.110
This is only a beginning. We've got
interesting times ahead of us.

2871
01:32:01.110 --> 01:32:02.010
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-Copenhagen Police.

2872
01:32:02.050 --> 01:32:02.740
-Do you know who she is?
-Yes.

2873
01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:04.700
Excuse me. A woman insists on
speaking to the person in charge.

2874
01:32:05.150 --> 01:32:06.240
-Is she in Sweden or Denmark?
-I don't know.

2875
01:32:06.510 --> 01:32:07.910
She's Swedish, and the car came
from Sweden. I assume I'm in charge.

2876
01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:10.440
-Saga Norén. Can I help you?
-When will you let traffic through?

2877
01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:11.540
-It might take up to two hours.
-I haven't got two hours!

2878
01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:12.340
-Back up.
-Is someone's life in danger?

2879
01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:13.150
There's a heart for my husband
in Copenhagen.

2880
01:32:13.190 --> 01:32:14.270
He needs a heart transplant.
Let us through.

2881
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:15.260
He'll have to wait.
I can't let anyone through.

2882
01:32:15.630 --> 01:32:16.750
-What's happened?
-Is there no other way through?

2883
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:17.790
There ought to be
another way through.

2884
01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:19.280
-No one's answering any questions.
-Let me pass, please.

2885
01:32:21.810 --> 01:32:23.120
The Öresund Bridge to Denmark
is closed.

2886
01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:24.040
According to the police it will...

2887
01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:29.960
-It's Stefan Lindberg.
-Hi, it's Veronika.

2888
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.380
-Sorry, did I wake you up?
-No, you didn't. How are you?

2889
01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:32.610
I can't sleep.
I've got a stomach ache.

2890
01:32:32.650 --> 01:32:33.710
-I see. How are the boys?
-They're asleep.

2891
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:34.790
They don't understand
what's about to happen.

2892
01:32:34.830 --> 01:32:36.110
-Can we meet up?
-Now?

2893
01:32:36.730 --> 01:32:37.580
Of course.
Do you want me to come over?

2894
01:32:38.010 --> 01:32:39.420
-No. I'd rather go to your place.
-OK.

2895
01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:40.400
-I can go to the office.
-I'll see you there.

2896
01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:44.050
Give me everything from
when the car came on to the bridge.

2897
01:32:44.090 --> 01:32:45.320
One camera records at a time.
They're started manually.

2898
01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:46.220
My colleague
might have recorded something.

2899
01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:47.290
Hello! Stop! Stop!

2900
01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:48.670
-Stop! Stop!
-I allowed it.

2901
01:32:48.710 --> 01:32:49.980
-Why? This is a crime scene.
-I'm fully aware of that.

2902
01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:50.770
-We've got enough bodies.
-He wasn't dying.

2903
01:32:50.810 --> 01:32:51.830
-Are you a doctor?
-No, I'm a police officer.

2904
01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:53.590
-What's your name?
-Martin Rohde.

2905
01:32:53.630 --> 01:32:54.530
-Rohde?
-R, O, H, D, E.

2906
01:32:54.570 --> 01:32:56.250
-Have you got an ID?
-It was an ambulance.

2907
01:32:56.290 --> 01:32:57.480
The Chairman
of Malmö City Council is dead.

2908
01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:58.820
-What evidence was destroyed?
-Probably none.

2909
01:32:58.860 --> 01:32:59.370
Thank you.

2910
01:33:05.810 --> 01:33:06.660
Hello. Hi. Finally.

2911
01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:08.110
I wont operate on Göran, Charlotte.
I had wine with my dinner.

2912
01:33:08.430 --> 01:33:10.000
-At what time? Are you drunk?
-No, but that doesn't matter.

2913
01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:11.320
You promised to see us through this.

2914
01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.440
-Morten Krag is a very good surgeon.
-Better than you?

2915
01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:13.350
I'll decide
who my husband's surgeon is!

2916
01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:14.860
-I wont forgive you if it goes wrong.
-What if I do it and it goes wrong?

2917
01:33:15.530 --> 01:33:16.420
Then I'll never forgive myself.

2918
01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:21.530
-We're done, you can move her.
-You can take her away.

2919
01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:24.150
Bloody hell.

2920
01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:29.640
The autopsy on Kerstin Ekwall
is being performed.

2921
01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:30.600
-And the recordings?
-They'll deliver them tomorrow.

2922
01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:31.400
-What about the press?
-They know.

2923
01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:32.500
The radio said that it was a woman.
They don't know who it is.

2924
01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:33.820
-And the family?
-I'm on my way to see them.

2925
01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:35.350
You'll wake them up, and there
are children there. Tread lightly.

2926
01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:36.940
In what sense? Oh. There aren't
that many ways to say it.

2927
01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:37.740
-Just tread lightly.
-Listen, Hans...

2928
01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:38.480
She was chopped in half.

2929
01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:39.590
-Right above the hips.
-What the hell are you saying?

2930
01:33:40.210 --> 01:33:41.670
She was due to attend a conference
in Copenhagen this morning.

2931
01:33:41.970 --> 01:33:43.030
-Have you got more computers?
-No.

2932
01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:43.960
Are you taking them?
The children's as well?

2933
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.140
-When did you last talk to her?
-She called yesterday.

2934
01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:46.190
-Do you know what time it was?
-I don't know.

2935
01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:47.260
Around half past six in the evening.

2936
01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:48.100
-Was she threatened?
-By whom?

2937
01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:48.910
I didn't say that she was,
I asked you.

2938
01:33:49.190 --> 01:33:50.850
Not really. She was a politician,
there were some calls and emails.

2939
01:33:50.890 --> 01:33:52.340
-Has she upset anyone lately?
-Lately...

2940
01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:53.580
She wanted to charge for
library loans. Some disapproved.

2941
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:54.600
-That's foolish.
-Sorry, what?

2942
01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:56.240
Reading becomes a money matter.
Social differences will grow.

2943
01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:57.200
-Is that why she was...?
-We don't know why.

2944
01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:57.980
It's unlikely
that library fees caused it.

2945
01:33:58.350 --> 01:33:59.230
Why? Why did someone do this?

2946
01:33:59.270 --> 01:34:00.920
Can you think of something personal?
Was she in debt? Did she use drugs?

2947
01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:01.690
Did she have an affair?

2948
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:06.100
Saga Norén.

2949
01:34:06.570 --> 01:34:07.170
Can't we talk on the phone?

2950
01:34:07.710 --> 01:34:08.640
I'll be there in twenty minutes. Bye.

2951
01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:20.560
August?

2952
01:34:33.610 --> 01:34:34.400
-Were you on the bridge?
-Yes.

2953
01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:35.460
-What happened?
-A murder, the Swedes will handle it.

2954
01:34:35.730 --> 01:34:36.310
-Did you check on August?
-Yes.

2955
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:37.230
-Is he asleep?
-Yes.

2956
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:38.340
You promised to talk to him.
He's become a night owl.

2957
01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:39.150
Do you want me to
wake him up now?

2958
01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:40.780
-He got up at three o'clock today.
-I'll have a word with him tomorrow.

2959
01:34:43.770 --> 01:34:44.900
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

2960
01:34:50.670 --> 01:34:52.140
-Do you know the cause of death?
-I can make a qualified guess.

2961
01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:53.120
She died six to eight hours ago.

2962
01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:54.410
Yes, she called home at six thirty
and was dumped just after midnight.

2963
01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:55.630
There's something else.

2964
01:34:55.670 --> 01:34:56.310
-What?
-Take a look.

2965
01:35:03.490 --> 01:35:05.090
No livor mortis on the ears.
That's consistent with the bleeding.

2966
01:35:05.130 --> 01:35:05.840
Petechiae on the conjunctivas.

2967
01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:07.220
The face is swollen.

2968
01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:09.300
She was strangled
and cut in half after death.

2969
01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:10.100
And the other half?

2970
01:35:11.530 --> 01:35:12.720
The lower body is much paler.
A lot paler.

2971
01:35:13.380 --> 01:35:14.580
It's not coherent with the bleeding
or how the body was placed.

2972
01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:16.800
There's brown discoloration.
Frostbite?

2973
01:35:17.070 --> 01:35:18.220
It feels different. Frostbite.

2974
01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:18.980
Not frostbite, deep-freezing.

2975
01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:20.210
For about a year, I think.
I've never seen anything like this.

2976
01:35:20.250 --> 01:35:21.500
I don't know who they belong to.
They're not Kerstin Ekwall's legs.

2977
01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:28.080
-So everyone's here, then.
-Yes.

2978
01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:28.620
Hi, Sebastian.

2979
01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:30.440
I don't know what to do.

2980
01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:31.520
I'm worried about tomorrow.
I had to see you.

2981
01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:32.330
Can't you just pay the rent?

2982
01:35:32.370 --> 01:35:33.810
They can't evict the children.
Can they? Their friends are there.

2983
01:35:33.850 --> 01:35:34.650
I paid out money for the rent.

2984
01:35:35.230 --> 01:35:36.200
-Why did you bring the children?
-Sören wasn't there.

2985
01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:37.210
I can't manage.

2986
01:35:37.410 --> 01:35:38.620
-Can't you make an exception?
-No. You know I can't.

2987
01:35:38.660 --> 01:35:39.630
-Please.
-There are guidelines. I'm sorry.

2988
01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:45.080
Charlotte Söringer? I'm Frederik
Henriksen, hospital administrator.

2989
01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:46.960
-Göran had atrial fibrillation.
-They managed to stop it.

2990
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.040
-He's to weak for surgery.
-Too weak?

2991
01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:49.260
-But there's a new heart.
-It will be given to someone else.

2992
01:35:49.630 --> 01:35:50.600
Anders said
that you need a new CT scanner.

2993
01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:52.220
My husband's business is doing well.
He's willing to donate a CT scanner.

2994
01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:53.030
We're cancelling for his own sake.

2995
01:35:53.070 --> 01:35:54.390
He'll die without a new heart.
I want both parties to benefit.

2996
01:35:54.430 --> 01:35:56.070
Pass my offer on
to the proper authority, please.

2997
01:36:01.710 --> 01:36:02.410
-Hello? Is this Martin Rohde?
-Yes.

2998
01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:03.580
-It's Saga Norén from the bridge.
-Yes, I remember.

2999
01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:05.270
-Were you asleep?
-I tend to doze off around this time.

3000
01:36:05.310 --> 01:36:06.160
-There were two women.
-You found another one.

3001
01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:07.130
The lower body
belonged to someone else.

3002
01:36:07.170 --> 01:36:08.430
-Have you found half a body?
-I don't know.

3003
01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:09.960
It could be more than a year ago.
The legs have been deep-frozen.

3004
01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.160
-Can you look into it? Now?
-First thing tomorrow morning.

3005
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:12.380
Can someone else
look into it straight away?

3006
01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:14.110
-I'll call you back.
-When?

3007
01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:16.640
-Do you have to get up?
-Yes.

3008
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:24.640
Missing woman, Caucasian,
at least a year ago...

3009
01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:25.340
-How old?
-Adult.

3010
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:26.380
-And life in general is OK?
-Yes.

3011
01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:27.100
-What about you?
-I'm fine.

3012
01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:28.920
-So you'll be firing blanks.
-Was it in the staff news bulletin?

3013
01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:30.360
-Is everything working as it should?
-It will in time.

3014
01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:31.040
It can't be much fun.

3015
01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:32.270
-What do you mean?
-You've heard about castrated toms?

3016
01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:33.970
A wild predator turns into
a chunky sleepyhead. Just like that.

3017
01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:35.860
They're castrated,
that's not the same thing.

3018
01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:37.030
Let's see what we've got.

3019
01:36:37.710 --> 01:36:38.330
Two women killed a year apart.

3020
01:36:38.370 --> 01:36:39.580
One was deep-frozen.
They were dismembered.

3021
01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:41.240
And assembled on the bridge.
Someone wants to make a statement.

3022
01:36:43.370 --> 01:36:44.010
-Saga Norén.
-It's Martin.

3023
01:36:44.050 --> 01:36:45.510
The lower body is Monique Brammer,
I think. A missing 23-year-old.

3024
01:36:45.550 --> 01:36:46.320
-Can you email the info?
-I'll be right over.

3025
01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:47.340
-Why do you want to come here?
-She's Danish.

3026
01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:48.550
I was first on the scene.
Everyone's still asleep here.

3027
01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:49.420
-Do you mind if I come over?
-Yes.

3028
01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:50.580
Make sure I'm allowed in.
You've got my details.

3029
01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:52.460
Martin Rohde has probably identified
the second body. He's coming over.

3030
01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:53.630
-Is that a problem?
-Yes...

3031
01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:54.500
No, no.

3032
01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:55.990
If half of the body is Danish,
we have to cooperate.

3033
01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:56.760
I'll schedule a meeting
at half past five.

3034
01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:57.760
-Can you be ready by then?
-Yes.

3035
01:37:04.770 --> 01:37:05.340
It finally worked out.

3036
01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:08.830
-What did you just sign?
-Formalities.

3037
01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:10.490
-Whose is it?
-What?

3038
01:37:10.530 --> 01:37:11.120
The heart. Whose is it?

3039
01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:12.210
A man's. He's 25 or 26
and had a motorcycle accident.

3040
01:37:13.090 --> 01:37:14.430
-What's his name?
-I don't know. Does it matter?

3041
01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:16.100
No, I guess it doesn't.

3042
01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:18.410
-I'm scared.
-It will be fine.

3043
01:37:18.830 --> 01:37:20.190
Anders will operate, they're all
highly skilled. It will be fine.

3044
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:21.120
I can't imagine life without you.

3045
01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:23.620
-I need to take Göran with me.
-Don't worry. You'll make it, honey.

3046
01:37:24.770 --> 01:37:25.380
-Hi.
-Hi.

3047
01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:26.220
-Hi! An early breakfast?
-No thank you.

3048
01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:27.630
-An email would have been faster.
-Yes, but not as pleasant.

3049
01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:29.390
-Where are you going?
-I'm coming in with you.

3050
01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:31.620
If it really is Monique Brammer,
we both have responsibilities.

3051
01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:33.340
Go straight on,
turn left, and register.

3052
01:37:36.010 --> 01:37:37.590
-Good morning. Coffee?
-No thanks, I've already had some.

3053
01:37:37.630 --> 01:37:38.960
I'm Martin Rohde.
I'll be working with Saga.

3054
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.530
-Thank you. You need to register.
-I also need a card.

3055
01:37:40.570 --> 01:37:41.320
-My name's Felicia.
-Nice to meet you.

3056
01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:42.680
-That's it. This is for you.
-Thank you.

3057
01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:43.980
-And one of these is for you.
-Thanks! Ooh, Danish.

3058
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:45.640
-See you later.
-I hope so.

3059
01:37:48.010 --> 01:37:49.500
-Where's Saga Norén?
-To the right. Bye!

3060
01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:53.380
Excuse me.

3061
01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:54.230
-Sit down.
-I'm afraid I can't.

3062
01:37:55.460 --> 01:37:56.750
-You make me nervous.
-OK, I can stand still.

3063
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:58.070
-Why can't you sit down?
-My nether regions hurt.

3064
01:37:58.520 --> 01:37:59.870
-I had a vasectomy yesterday.
-Right.

3065
01:37:59.910 --> 01:38:00.740
I've got five children
with three different women.

3066
01:38:01.090 --> 01:38:02.090
-Have you got children?
-No, why would I want to?

3067
01:38:02.130 --> 01:38:03.200
-I've never heard anyone ask that.
-Many should have.

3068
01:38:04.370 --> 01:38:05.380
Not you,
I'm sure you're a wonderful dad.

3069
01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:09.060
-Why aren't you off sick?
-I can't afford it. August moved in.

3070
01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:10.850
Well, it's not really about money.
It was a small procedure, I can work.

3071
01:38:10.890 --> 01:38:11.750
-You can't sit down.
-I can.

3072
01:38:11.790 --> 01:38:12.860
-I drove here.
-Pretend that the chair is a car.

3073
01:38:14.610 --> 01:38:15.110
Yes.

3074
01:38:17.650 --> 01:38:18.720
-No one wanted to solve the case.
-What do you mean?

3075
01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:19.600
Monique Brammer
was reported missing.

3076
01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:21.130
Two prostitutes and a neighbour were
interviewed. The case was shelved.

3077
01:38:21.370 --> 01:38:22.030
It fell between two stools.

3078
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:23.310
She disappeared, or she was killed.
They didn't find a body.

3079
01:38:23.730 --> 01:38:24.460
The case was
supposed to be shelved.

3080
01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:25.680
I'm surprised it took two weeks.
Come with me.

3081
01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:30.080
Do you think I should?
I tried painkillers, but...

3082
01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:31.650
-Two computers?
-They know who it is now.

3083
01:38:31.690 --> 01:38:32.450
-Will Saga handle the case, Hans?
-Yes.

3084
01:38:32.490 --> 01:38:33.380
-That's good.
-And a Danish police officer.

3085
01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:35.170
-Does he know that she's a bit odd?
-If not, he'll soon find out.

3086
01:38:36.590 --> 01:38:37.530
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

3087
01:38:37.570 --> 01:38:38.780
-This is Martin Röhde.
-It's Rohde.

3088
01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:40.080
Not as when you say "fur".
Rohde, Foure...

3089
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:42.070
-Have you read the file?
-Most people have just arrived.

3090
01:38:42.110 --> 01:38:43.140
Half of two female bodies were found.
One was Kerstin Ekwall.

3091
01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:43.920
The other one has been deep-frozen.
Martin?

3092
01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:45.280
It's probably the 23-year-old
Monique Brammer from Copenhagen.

3093
01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:46.500
A prostitute and an addict
that went missing 13 months ago.

3094
01:38:47.150 --> 01:38:48.140
Do you want me to repeat that?
A bit slower?

3095
01:38:48.330 --> 01:38:49.290
Monique Brammer, 23 years old.
A prostitute and an addict.

3096
01:38:49.330 --> 01:38:50.190
She went missing 13 months ago.

3097
01:38:50.230 --> 01:38:51.760
-Right.
-The investigation was inadequate.

3098
01:38:52.580 --> 01:38:54.080
-Don't you agree?
-Yes. It was terrible.

3099
01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:55.190
But we found blood traces
in her apartment.

3100
01:38:55.230 --> 01:38:56.580
The samples are on their way
and can be compared to the body.

3101
01:38:56.620 --> 01:38:57.810
Before the bodies were dumped,
the power was cut for 48 seconds.

3102
01:38:57.850 --> 01:38:58.830
Their trying to trace the signal.
Can you help them, Gry?

3103
01:38:58.870 --> 01:38:59.850
-How was it done?
-Someone accessed a computer.

3104
01:38:59.890 --> 01:39:00.330
Can you show me the fourth picture?

3105
01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:01.370
Use all the people you need. Gry?

3106
01:39:01.410 --> 01:39:02.750
Here's Ekwall's mobile number.
Get the phone records.

3107
01:39:02.790 --> 01:39:03.890
Check her computers.
Talk to John about passwords.

3108
01:39:03.930 --> 01:39:04.800
Anne?
Find out where she was abducted.

3109
01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:06.030
She left work half past six.
She had a car. Find it!

3110
01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:07.470
-Were they dumped from her car?
-No, a black Cadillac Escalade.

3111
01:39:07.510 --> 01:39:08.930
The image where the bridge
is seen from above.

3112
01:39:08.970 --> 01:39:10.290
-John can find the license number.
-What? Sure.

3113
01:39:10.330 --> 01:39:11.280
-What are you doing?
-I had an idea.

3114
01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:12.810
The orange line the body was on...
We discussed where she was.

3115
01:39:12.850 --> 01:39:13.660
Here's the Swedish-Danish border.

3116
01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:14.760
One half is in Sweden,
one is in Denmark.

3117
01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:15.870
-It's millimetre perfect.
-Tell me everything about the line.

3118
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:16.500
Take paint samples.

3119
01:39:16.540 --> 01:39:18.070
Power cut, body halves, a politician.
We'll be in the public eye.

3120
01:39:26.590 --> 01:39:28.080
-Hi. Is Veronika at home?
-Yes.

3121
01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:28.970
-What do you want?
-I would like to talk to her.

3122
01:39:29.010 --> 01:39:30.210
-You can talk to me.
-I would if you were clean.

3123
01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:31.390
-What? I am clean.
-Hi, Veronika.

3124
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:32.870
-Isn't it enough to have us evicted?
-The landlord did that.

3125
01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:34.780
-You're not helping.
-I'm trying. I'm trying really hard.

3126
01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:36.280
If you had been more dependable,
you wouldn't have to move.

3127
01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:38.710
-That was bloody stupid.
-Sören! Stop it!

3128
01:39:40.810 --> 01:39:41.310
What the hell?

3129
01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:43.590
Stop, you bastard!

3130
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:46.100
Stop! Come out!

3131
01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:49.760
Sören! Stop it, Sören! Stop it!

3132
01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:50.680
-I hate that bloody bastard!
-Sören!

3133
01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:52.420
He's caused trouble all along.
It makes me so angry!

3134
01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:53.930
Let go of me.
Go to hell, you bloody idiots.

3135
01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:04.490
-How's the operation going?
-It hasn't started.

3136
01:40:04.530 --> 01:40:05.620
-Why? He was prepared hours ago.
-I don't know.

3137
01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:06.350
I'm afraid I have to go.

3138
01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:07.880
-Don't you know where he is?
-You probably know better than me.

3139
01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:09.320
We'll call you if we hear from him...
Let's go.

3140
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:11.050
-I'm sorry about all of this.
-Stop apologizing for him.

3141
01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:12.950
He's an adult
and makes his own decisions.

3142
01:40:12.990 --> 01:40:14.580
Maybe you should do the same?
Sören put you in this position.

3143
01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:16.160
You spend your money wisely,
but can't if you're not given any.

3144
01:40:16.650 --> 01:40:17.570
You don't get the chance
to care for your boys.

3145
01:40:18.090 --> 01:40:19.140
-He hits you and the children.
-Hardly ever the children.

3146
01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:20.170
Hardly ever? That's not good enough.

3147
01:40:20.530 --> 01:40:21.260
He shouldn't hit any of you.

3148
01:40:21.570 --> 01:40:23.210
You can get your life back on track.
Just you and the children.

3149
01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:25.250
Leave your husband
or nothing will change.

3150
01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:26.580
Think about it.

3151
01:40:29.610 --> 01:40:31.270
-Anders? What's going on?
-We've got a problem.

3152
01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:32.740
The donor was declared brain dead,
and a nurse spoke to his father.

3153
01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:34.100
The father changed his mind.
We can't have the heart. Göran!

3154
01:40:40.370 --> 01:40:41.000
Wasn't that the turn-off?

3155
01:40:41.570 --> 01:40:42.710
-Stefan? Wasn't that the turn-off?
-No, not today.

3156
01:40:43.330 --> 01:40:44.360
-Where are we going?
-You'll see.

3157
01:40:51.630 --> 01:40:53.230
Johan was nicknamed "The old bag".
He died a month ago.

3158
01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:55.100
No wife, no children, no debts,
no assets. The house was all he had.

3159
01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:56.110
It went to the local council.

3160
01:40:58.860 --> 01:40:59.360
It's Sören.

3161
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:01.290
Come.

3162
01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:10.470
-Step inside.
-What about the children?

3163
01:41:10.510 --> 01:41:11.190
They can stay outside a while longer.

3164
01:41:12.630 --> 01:41:14.080
-Where are we? Why are we here?
-Just go inside.

3165
01:41:16.990 --> 01:41:18.440
-Crime scene and meeting place.
-Have you worked here a long time?

3166
01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:19.030
-More than ten years?
-Yes.

3167
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:20.150
-Are you from around here?
-From Malmö? No.

3168
01:41:20.190 --> 01:41:21.910
I'm from Copenhagen.
I was born there.

3169
01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:24.390
No wonder Ingmar Bergman
and Lars Norén are from Sweden.

3170
01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:25.660
-Are you related to Lars Norén?
-No.

3171
01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:26.900
We need to find the meeting place
and the crime scene.

3172
01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:28.120
Where did the perpetrator
meet the victim?

3173
01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:32.780
I've spoken to Copenhagen.
You'll cooperate on the deaths.

3174
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.820
Here's info about your authority.

3175
01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:35.020
I know what applies to me
in Denmark.

3176
01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:36.410
-Can I have a word with you, Saga?
-Yes.

3177
01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:38.800
The report you filed
against Martin...

3178
01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:39.470
Yes, there's only one.

3179
01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:40.480
What do you suggest I do with it?

3180
01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:41.480
Don't you think
it will affect your cooperation?

3181
01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:42.590
-Do you think so?
-I think there's every chance.

3182
01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:43.890
-Will he dislike me?
-That might happen.

3183
01:41:43.930 --> 01:41:45.450
Because of my report?
It doesn't have to affect the case.

3184
01:41:45.490 --> 01:41:46.490
He let an ambulance through.
No life was in danger.

3185
01:41:46.530 --> 01:41:47.500
-I'm supposed to file a report.
-I'll handle the report.

3186
01:41:47.540 --> 01:41:49.160
-Yes, that's fine. Fine.
-I've got the car's license number.

3187
01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:50.010
It belongs to Daniel Farbé in Malmö.

3188
01:41:50.050 --> 01:41:50.920
-The journalist?
-Yes, he's a journalist.

3189
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:54.150
-Do you know who he is?
-Yes. I read his column.

3190
01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:55.440
It's entertaining.

3191
01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:10.340
-You made me jump.
-I worked all night.

3192
01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:11.570
-I'm done for the week. Berlin next.
-You work all night.

3193
01:42:11.610 --> 01:42:12.470
Then you get down in Berlin.
How do you manage?

3194
01:42:12.510 --> 01:42:13.640
Get down?
How many children have you got?

3195
01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:14.560
Children that suck the life
out of you.

3196
01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:16.250
I haven't got children. No one says
"get down" any more. No one.

3197
01:42:16.890 --> 01:42:17.540
-Have fun.
-I will.

3198
01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:18.250
I downloaded
"Elephants in the Desert".

3199
01:42:18.730 --> 01:42:19.320
What do you want, Åke?

3200
01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:20.420
A hug, an award, an applause?
Would you like one?

3201
01:42:21.010 --> 01:42:22.160
-They're really cool. I like them.
-Yes, they were cool.

3202
01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:23.590
What?
Two weeks ago you really liked them.

3203
01:42:23.630 --> 01:42:24.180
And now you like them.

3204
01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:25.250
My daughter...

3205
01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:27.370
-She danced all afternoon.
-Sorry, I have to answer.

3206
01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:28.750
We'll have to continue this later.

3207
01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:31.470
You and the boys will disappear.

3208
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:32.370
Your paperwork
and your debts are gone.

3209
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:34.110
You can make a fresh start.
Do you understand?

3210
01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:36.300
You can make a fresh start.
There's cash and a mobile here.

3211
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:37.980
But you can never see or talk to
your husband again.

3212
01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:39.580
He's their dad.
I have to let them see him.

3213
01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:40.660
Why? Why do they have to?

3214
01:42:41.330 --> 01:42:42.900
To get another beating?
To be scared and broke?

3215
01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:44.460
Let him spend everything on drugs?
He'll ruin everything for you again.

3216
01:42:44.820 --> 01:42:45.520
People like him ruin things.

3217
01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:47.190
You don't know me.
Why are you doing this?

3218
01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:50.250
Because I can.

3219
01:43:01.710 --> 01:43:02.210
Bloody hell.

3220
01:43:10.410 --> 01:43:11.280
-Here's my car.
-Do you think it's him?

3221
01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:12.540
He kept a body in a freezer
and killed a politician.

3222
01:43:12.580 --> 01:43:13.630
-He wouldn't use his own car.
-Nice car.

3223
01:43:13.670 --> 01:43:14.930
-Is the Swedish police paid well?
-No, the same as in Denmark.

3224
01:43:14.970 --> 01:43:16.360
Don't jump to conclusions
about my wages based on my car.

3225
01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:17.650
Maybe it was a gift?
Maybe I inherited it or had savings?

3226
01:43:17.690 --> 01:43:18.920
I hope your professional conclusions
are more valid.

3227
01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:20.210
Read this.
It's Daniel Ferbé's latest column.

3228
01:43:20.250 --> 01:43:21.500
-The one that's a good writer?
-No, I said he's entertaining.

3229
01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:22.170
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

3230
01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:35.900
Hello? What's going on?

3231
01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:37.250
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-A Cadillac has a bomb in it.

3232
01:43:37.290 --> 01:43:38.290
Is it a black Escalade?
It's tied to a double homicide.

3233
01:43:38.330 --> 01:43:39.820
-Is the guy trying to kill himself?
-I don't think he was involved.

3234
01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:41.150
No, you're not going
anywhere near the place.

3235
01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:49.670
Help! Help!

3236
01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:50.560
-Take it easy.
-Please help me!

3237
01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:51.720
-Help me! Get me out!
-Calm down.

3238
01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:54.260
-Help me!
-The windshield is wired in.

3239
01:43:54.300 --> 01:43:55.250
The side windows are
connected to the electrical system.

3240
01:43:55.290 --> 01:43:56.680
The glass seems OK,
but there are wires everywhere.

3241
01:43:58.650 --> 01:43:59.320
We've got his contact details.

3242
01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:04.610
-What's going on?
-My mobile!

3243
01:44:04.650 --> 01:44:05.850
-Yes?
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

3244
01:44:05.890 --> 01:44:07.260
I need to know whether you were
on the bridge last night.

3245
01:44:07.550 --> 01:44:08.360
-What?
-Were you on the Öresund Bridge?

3246
01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:09.470
I was working.
I was here all the time.

3247
01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:10.840
-How will you get me out?
-I don't know, that's not my job.

3248
01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:11.950
-Do you know Kerstin Ekwall?
-Who?

3249
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.880
Daniel? Did you do anything
apart from turn the key?

3250
01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:14.260
No. Everything locked.
The countdown started.

3251
01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:15.090
-Hello?
-I'm talking to the bomb guy.

3252
01:44:15.130 --> 01:44:15.900
Chairman of the City Council
Kerstin Ekwall.

3253
01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:17.390
-Have you written about her?
-No, I don't know.

3254
01:44:17.430 --> 01:44:18.510
-Have you been tipped off about her?
-No! What is this?

3255
01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:19.210
Get me out! Please!

3256
01:44:19.250 --> 01:44:20.370
Does anyone else
have a key to your car?

3257
01:44:20.410 --> 01:44:21.810
-No, I don't know.
-Can you reach it?

3258
01:44:21.850 --> 01:44:22.730
I don't want to die. Please.

3259
01:44:22.770 --> 01:44:24.050
-I don't want it to end like this.
-Daniel? You need to talk to me.

3260
01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:26.630
It skipped a minute.
What the hell did you do?

3261
01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:28.420
It was three, now it's two.
It was three.

3262
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:29.840
Come one, hurry up.

3263
01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:31.140
Where are you going?
Stay here! Please!

3264
01:44:31.740 --> 01:44:33.330
Please! Come back!
Where are you going?

3265
01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:37.980
You need to talk to me.
Daniel? Daniel?

3266
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.950
Is it a big bomb?

3267
01:44:39.890 --> 01:44:41.050
-I think so.
-You're not religious, right?

3268
01:44:41.090 --> 01:44:41.760
You're an atheist?

3269
01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:43.320
Everything will just stop. The body
won't have time to register pain.

3270
01:44:44.430 --> 01:44:45.850
-Are you sure?
-Don't look at the clock. Listen.

3271
01:44:45.890 --> 01:44:47.290
Do you know why your car
was used to dump two bodies?

3272
01:44:47.970 --> 01:44:48.780
-No.
-Think about it. Focus.

3273
01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:50.200
-Who did this to you?
-I've slagged so many people off.

3274
01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:54.420
Daniel? Are you still there? Hello?

3275
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.790
It's clean.

3276
01:45:03.690 --> 01:45:04.850
Sorry about the drama, it's hard
to make oneself heard today.

3277
01:45:04.890 --> 01:45:05.670
I assume I have your attention now.

3278
01:45:05.710 --> 01:45:07.310
Our part of the world would be
wonderful if we solved our problems.

3279
01:45:07.350 --> 01:45:08.180
I would like to
point out five in particular.

3280
01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:09.840
This is only a beginning. We've got
interesting times ahead of us.

3281
01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:10.740
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-Copenhagen Police.

3282
01:45:10.780 --> 01:45:11.470
-Do you know who she is?
-Yes.

3283
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:13.430
Excuse me. A woman insists on
speaking to the person in charge.

3284
01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:14.970
-Is she in Sweden or Denmark?
-I don't know.

3285
01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:16.640
She's Swedish, and the car came
from Sweden. I assume I'm in charge.

3286
01:45:18.030 --> 01:45:19.170
-Saga Norén. Can I help you?
-When will you let traffic through?

3287
01:45:19.210 --> 01:45:20.270
-It might take up to two hours.
-I haven't got two hours!

3288
01:45:20.310 --> 01:45:21.070
-Back up.
-Is someone's life in danger?

3289
01:45:21.110 --> 01:45:21.880
There's a heart for my husband
in Copenhagen.

3290
01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:23.000
He needs a heart transplant.
Let us through.

3291
01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:23.990
He'll have to wait.
I can't let anyone through.

3292
01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:25.480
-What's happened?
-Is there no other way through?

3293
01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:26.520
There ought to be
another way through.

3294
01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:28.010
-No one's answering any questions.
-Let me pass, please.

3295
01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:31.850
The Öresund Bridge to Denmark
is closed.

3296
01:45:31.890 --> 01:45:32.770
According to the police it will...

3297
01:45:37.450 --> 01:45:38.690
-It's Stefan Lindberg.
-Hi, it's Veronika.

3298
01:45:38.730 --> 01:45:40.110
-Sorry, did I wake you up?
-No, you didn't. How are you?

3299
01:45:40.150 --> 01:45:41.340
I can't sleep.
I've got a stomach ache.

3300
01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:42.440
-I see. How are the boys?
-They're asleep.

3301
01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:43.520
They don't understand
what's about to happen.

3302
01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:44.840
-Can we meet up?
-Now?

3303
01:45:45.460 --> 01:45:46.310
Of course.
Do you want me to come over?

3304
01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:48.150
-No. I'd rather go to your place.
-OK.

3305
01:45:48.190 --> 01:45:49.130
-I can go to the office.
-I'll see you there.

3306
01:45:51.750 --> 01:45:52.780
Give me everything from
when the car came on to the bridge.

3307
01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:54.050
One camera records at a time.
They're started manually.

3308
01:45:54.090 --> 01:45:54.950
My colleague
might have recorded something.

3309
01:45:54.990 --> 01:45:56.020
Hello! Stop! Stop!

3310
01:45:56.060 --> 01:45:57.400
-Stop! Stop!
-I allowed it.

3311
01:45:57.440 --> 01:45:58.710
-Why? This is a crime scene.
-I'm fully aware of that.

3312
01:45:58.750 --> 01:45:59.500
-We've got enough bodies.
-He wasn't dying.

3313
01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:00.560
-Are you a doctor?
-No, I'm a police officer.

3314
01:46:01.150 --> 01:46:02.320
-What's your name?
-Martin Rohde.

3315
01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:03.260
-Rohde?
-R, O, H, D, E.

3316
01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:04.980
-Have you got an ID?
-It was an ambulance.

3317
01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:06.210
The Chairman
of Malmö City Council is dead.

3318
01:46:06.250 --> 01:46:07.550
-What evidence was destroyed?
-Probably none.

3319
01:46:07.590 --> 01:46:08.100
Thank you.

3320
01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:15.390
Hello. Hi. Finally.

3321
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:16.840
I wont operate on Göran, Charlotte.
I had wine with my dinner.

3322
01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:18.730
-At what time? Are you drunk?
-No, but that doesn't matter.

3323
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:20.050
You promised to see us through this.

3324
01:46:20.090 --> 01:46:21.170
-Morten Krag is a very good surgeon.
-Better than you?

3325
01:46:21.210 --> 01:46:22.080
I'll decide
who my husband's surgeon is!

3326
01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:23.590
-I wont forgive you if it goes wrong.
-What if I do it and it goes wrong?

3327
01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:25.150
Then I'll never forgive myself.

3328
01:46:29.050 --> 01:46:30.260
-We're done, you can move her.
-You can take her away.

3329
01:46:32.350 --> 01:46:32.880
Bloody hell.

3330
01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:38.370
The autopsy on Kerstin Ekwall
is being performed.

3331
01:46:38.410 --> 01:46:39.330
-And the recordings?
-They'll deliver them tomorrow.

3332
01:46:39.370 --> 01:46:40.130
-What about the press?
-They know.

3333
01:46:40.170 --> 01:46:41.230
The radio said that it was a woman.
They don't know who it is.

3334
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:42.550
-And the family?
-I'm on my way to see them.

3335
01:46:42.590 --> 01:46:44.080
You'll wake them up, and there
are children there. Tread lightly.

3336
01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:45.670
In what sense? Oh. There aren't
that many ways to say it.

3337
01:46:45.710 --> 01:46:46.470
-Just tread lightly.
-Listen, Hans...

3338
01:46:46.510 --> 01:46:47.210
She was chopped in half.

3339
01:46:47.250 --> 01:46:48.320
-Right above the hips.
-What the hell are you saying?

3340
01:46:48.940 --> 01:46:50.400
She was due to attend a conference
in Copenhagen this morning.

3341
01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:51.760
-Have you got more computers?
-No.

3342
01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:52.690
Are you taking them?
The children's as well?

3343
01:46:52.730 --> 01:46:53.870
-When did you last talk to her?
-She called yesterday.

3344
01:46:54.090 --> 01:46:54.920
-Do you know what time it was?
-I don't know.

3345
01:46:55.150 --> 01:46:55.990
Around half past six in the evening.

3346
01:46:56.030 --> 01:46:56.830
-Was she threatened?
-By whom?

3347
01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:57.640
I didn't say that she was,
I asked you.

3348
01:46:57.920 --> 01:46:59.580
Not really. She was a politician,
there were some calls and emails.

3349
01:46:59.620 --> 01:47:01.070
-Has she upset anyone lately?
-Lately...

3350
01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:02.310
She wanted to charge for
library loans. Some disapproved.

3351
01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:03.330
-That's foolish.
-Sorry, what?

3352
01:47:03.370 --> 01:47:04.970
Reading becomes a money matter.
Social differences will grow.

3353
01:47:05.010 --> 01:47:05.930
-Is that why she was...?
-We don't know why.

3354
01:47:05.970 --> 01:47:06.710
It's unlikely
that library fees caused it.

3355
01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:07.960
Why? Why did someone do this?

3356
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.650
Can you think of something personal?
Was she in debt? Did she use drugs?

3357
01:47:09.690 --> 01:47:10.420
Did she have an affair?

3358
01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:14.830
Saga Norén.

3359
01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:15.900
Can't we talk on the phone?

3360
01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:17.370
I'll be there in twenty minutes. Bye.

3361
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:29.290
August?

3362
01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:43.130
-Were you on the bridge?
-Yes.

3363
01:47:43.170 --> 01:47:44.190
-What happened?
-A murder, the Swedes will handle it.

3364
01:47:44.460 --> 01:47:45.040
-Did you check on August?
-Yes.

3365
01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:45.960
-Is he asleep?
-Yes.

3366
01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:47.070
You promised to talk to him.
He's become a night owl.

3367
01:47:47.110 --> 01:47:47.880
Do you want me to
wake him up now?

3368
01:47:48.170 --> 01:47:49.510
-He got up at three o'clock today.
-I'll have a word with him tomorrow.

3369
01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:53.630
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

3370
01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:00.870
-Do you know the cause of death?
-I can make a qualified guess.

3371
01:48:00.910 --> 01:48:01.850
She died six to eight hours ago.

3372
01:48:01.890 --> 01:48:03.140
Yes, she called home at six thirty
and was dumped just after midnight.

3373
01:48:03.550 --> 01:48:04.360
There's something else.

3374
01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:05.040
-What?
-Take a look.

3375
01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:13.820
No livor mortis on the ears.
That's consistent with the bleeding.

3376
01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:14.570
Petechiae on the conjunctivas.

3377
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.950
The face is swollen.

3378
01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:18.030
She was strangled
and cut in half after death.

3379
01:48:18.270 --> 01:48:18.830
And the other half?

3380
01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:21.450
The lower body is much paler.
A lot paler.

3381
01:48:22.110 --> 01:48:23.310
It's not coherent with the bleeding
or how the body was placed.

3382
01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:25.530
There's brown discoloration.
Frostbite?

3383
01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:26.950
It feels different. Frostbite.

3384
01:48:26.990 --> 01:48:27.710
Not frostbite, deep-freezing.

3385
01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:28.940
For about a year, I think.
I've never seen anything like this.

3386
01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:30.230
I don't know who they belong to.
They're not Kerstin Ekwall's legs.

3387
01:48:35.930 --> 01:48:36.810
-So everyone's here, then.
-Yes.

3388
01:48:36.850 --> 01:48:37.350
Hi, Sebastian.

3389
01:48:38.590 --> 01:48:39.170
I don't know what to do.

3390
01:48:39.210 --> 01:48:40.250
I'm worried about tomorrow.
I had to see you.

3391
01:48:40.290 --> 01:48:41.060
Can't you just pay the rent?

3392
01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:42.540
They can't evict the children.
Can they? Their friends are there.

3393
01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:43.380
I paid out money for the rent.

3394
01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:44.930
-Why did you bring the children?
-Sören wasn't there.

3395
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.940
I can't manage.

3396
01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:47.350
-Can't you make an exception?
-No. You know I can't.

3397
01:48:47.390 --> 01:48:48.360
-Please.
-There are guidelines. I'm sorry.

3398
01:48:52.530 --> 01:48:53.810
Charlotte Söringer? I'm Frederik
Henriksen, hospital administrator.

3399
01:48:54.390 --> 01:48:55.690
-Göran had atrial fibrillation.
-They managed to stop it.

3400
01:48:55.730 --> 01:48:56.770
-He's to weak for surgery.
-Too weak?

3401
01:48:56.810 --> 01:48:57.990
-But there's a new heart.
-It will be given to someone else.

3402
01:48:58.360 --> 01:48:59.330
Anders said
that you need a new CT scanner.

3403
01:48:59.370 --> 01:49:00.950
My husband's business is doing well.
He's willing to donate a CT scanner.

3404
01:49:00.990 --> 01:49:01.760
We're cancelling for his own sake.

3405
01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:03.120
He'll die without a new heart.
I want both parties to benefit.

3406
01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:04.800
Pass my offer on
to the proper authority, please.

3407
01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:11.140
-Hello? Is this Martin Rohde?
-Yes.

3408
01:49:11.180 --> 01:49:12.310
-It's Saga Norén from the bridge.
-Yes, I remember.

3409
01:49:12.350 --> 01:49:14.000
-Were you asleep?
-I tend to doze off around this time.

3410
01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:14.890
-There were two women.
-You found another one.

3411
01:49:14.930 --> 01:49:15.860
The lower body
belonged to someone else.

3412
01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:17.160
-Have you found half a body?
-I don't know.

3413
01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:18.690
It could be more than a year ago.
The legs have been deep-frozen.

3414
01:49:18.730 --> 01:49:19.890
-Can you look into it? Now?
-First thing tomorrow morning.

3415
01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:21.110
Can someone else
look into it straight away?

3416
01:49:21.910 --> 01:49:22.840
-I'll call you back.
-When?

3417
01:49:24.730 --> 01:49:25.370
-Do you have to get up?
-Yes.

3418
01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:33.370
Missing woman, Caucasian,
at least a year ago...

3419
01:49:33.410 --> 01:49:34.070
-How old?
-Adult.

3420
01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:35.110
-And life in general is OK?
-Yes.

3421
01:49:35.150 --> 01:49:35.830
-What about you?
-I'm fine.

3422
01:49:36.310 --> 01:49:37.650
-So you'll be firing blanks.
-Was it in the staff news bulletin?

3423
01:49:37.690 --> 01:49:39.090
-Is everything working as it should?
-It will in time.

3424
01:49:39.130 --> 01:49:39.770
It can't be much fun.

3425
01:49:39.810 --> 01:49:41.000
-What do you mean?
-You've heard about castrated toms?

3426
01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:42.700
A wild predator turns into
a chunky sleepyhead. Just like that.

3427
01:49:43.290 --> 01:49:44.590
They're castrated,
that's not the same thing.

3428
01:49:45.070 --> 01:49:45.760
Let's see what we've got.

3429
01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:47.060
Two women killed a year apart.

3430
01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:48.310
One was deep-frozen.
They were dismembered.

3431
01:49:48.350 --> 01:49:49.970
And assembled on the bridge.
Someone wants to make a statement.

3432
01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:52.740
-Saga Norén.
-It's Martin.

3433
01:49:52.780 --> 01:49:54.240
The lower body is Monique Brammer,
I think. A missing 23-year-old.

3434
01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:55.050
-Can you email the info?
-I'll be right over.

3435
01:49:55.090 --> 01:49:56.070
-Why do you want to come here?
-She's Danish.

3436
01:49:56.110 --> 01:49:57.280
I was first on the scene.
Everyone's still asleep here.

3437
01:49:57.320 --> 01:49:58.150
-Do you mind if I come over?
-Yes.

3438
01:49:58.190 --> 01:49:59.310
Make sure I'm allowed in.
You've got my details.

3439
01:49:59.710 --> 01:50:01.190
Martin Rohde has probably identified
the second body. He's coming over.

3440
01:50:01.230 --> 01:50:02.360
-Is that a problem?
-Yes...

3441
01:50:02.710 --> 01:50:03.230
No, no.

3442
01:50:03.270 --> 01:50:04.720
If half of the body is Danish,
we have to cooperate.

3443
01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:05.490
I'll schedule a meeting
at half past five.

3444
01:50:05.530 --> 01:50:06.490
-Can you be ready by then?
-Yes.

3445
01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:14.070
It finally worked out.

3446
01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:17.560
-What did you just sign?
-Formalities.

3447
01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:19.220
-Whose is it?
-What?

3448
01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:19.850
The heart. Whose is it?

3449
01:50:19.890 --> 01:50:20.940
A man's. He's 25 or 26
and had a motorcycle accident.

3450
01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:23.160
-What's his name?
-I don't know. Does it matter?

3451
01:50:23.850 --> 01:50:24.830
No, I guess it doesn't.

3452
01:50:25.790 --> 01:50:27.140
-I'm scared.
-It will be fine.

3453
01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:28.920
Anders will operate, they're all
highly skilled. It will be fine.

3454
01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:29.850
I can't imagine life without you.

3455
01:50:30.670 --> 01:50:32.350
-I need to take Göran with me.
-Don't worry. You'll make it, honey.

3456
01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:34.110
-Hi.
-Hi.

3457
01:50:34.150 --> 01:50:34.950
-Hi! An early breakfast?
-No thank you.

3458
01:50:34.990 --> 01:50:36.360
-An email would have been faster.
-Yes, but not as pleasant.

3459
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:38.120
-Where are you going?
-I'm coming in with you.

3460
01:50:38.540 --> 01:50:40.350
If it really is Monique Brammer,
we both have responsibilities.

3461
01:50:41.150 --> 01:50:42.070
Go straight on,
turn left, and register.

3462
01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:46.320
-Good morning. Coffee?
-No thanks, I've already had some.

3463
01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:47.690
I'm Martin Rohde.
I'll be working with Saga.

3464
01:50:47.730 --> 01:50:49.260
-Thank you. You need to register.
-I also need a card.

3465
01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:50.050
-My name's Felicia.
-Nice to meet you.

3466
01:50:50.510 --> 01:50:51.410
-That's it. This is for you.
-Thank you.

3467
01:50:51.450 --> 01:50:52.710
-And one of these is for you.
-Thanks! Ooh, Danish.

3468
01:50:53.730 --> 01:50:54.370
-See you later.
-I hope so.

3469
01:50:56.740 --> 01:50:58.230
-Where's Saga Norén?
-To the right. Bye!

3470
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:02.110
Excuse me.

3471
01:51:02.150 --> 01:51:02.960
-Sit down.
-I'm afraid I can't.

3472
01:51:04.190 --> 01:51:05.480
-You make me nervous.
-OK, I can stand still.

3473
01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:06.800
-Why can't you sit down?
-My nether regions hurt.

3474
01:51:07.250 --> 01:51:08.600
-I had a vasectomy yesterday.
-Right.

3475
01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:09.470
I've got five children
with three different women.

3476
01:51:09.820 --> 01:51:10.820
-Have you got children?
-No, why would I want to?

3477
01:51:10.860 --> 01:51:11.930
-I've never heard anyone ask that.
-Many should have.

3478
01:51:13.100 --> 01:51:14.110
Not you,
I'm sure you're a wonderful dad.

3479
01:51:16.490 --> 01:51:17.790
-Why aren't you off sick?
-I can't afford it. August moved in.

3480
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:19.580
Well, it's not really about money.
It was a small procedure, I can work.

3481
01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:20.480
-You can't sit down.
-I can.

3482
01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:21.590
-I drove here.
-Pretend that the chair is a car.

3483
01:51:23.340 --> 01:51:23.840
Yes.

3484
01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:27.450
-No one wanted to solve the case.
-What do you mean?

3485
01:51:27.490 --> 01:51:28.330
Monique Brammer
was reported missing.

3486
01:51:28.370 --> 01:51:29.860
Two prostitutes and a neighbour were
interviewed. The case was shelved.

3487
01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:30.760
It fell between two stools.

3488
01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:32.040
She disappeared, or she was killed.
They didn't find a body.

3489
01:51:32.460 --> 01:51:33.190
The case was
supposed to be shelved.

3490
01:51:33.230 --> 01:51:34.410
I'm surprised it took two weeks.
Come with me.

3491
01:51:37.710 --> 01:51:38.810
Do you think I should?
I tried painkillers, but...

3492
01:51:39.570 --> 01:51:40.380
-Two computers?
-They know who it is now.

3493
01:51:40.420 --> 01:51:41.180
-Will Saga handle the case, Hans?
-Yes.

3494
01:51:41.220 --> 01:51:42.110
-That's good.
-And a Danish police officer.

3495
01:51:42.150 --> 01:51:43.900
-Does he know that she's a bit odd?
-If not, he'll soon find out.

3496
01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:46.260
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

3497
01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:47.510
-This is Martin Röhde.
-It's Rohde.

3498
01:51:47.550 --> 01:51:48.810
Not as when you say "fur".
Rohde, Foure...

3499
01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:50.800
-Have you read the file?
-Most people have just arrived.

3500
01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:51.870
Half of two female bodies were found.
One was Kerstin Ekwall.

3501
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:52.650
The other one has been deep-frozen.
Martin?

3502
01:51:52.690 --> 01:51:54.010
It's probably the 23-year-old
Monique Brammer from Copenhagen.

3503
01:51:54.050 --> 01:51:55.230
A prostitute and an addict
that went missing 13 months ago.

3504
01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:56.870
Do you want me to repeat that?
A bit slower?

3505
01:51:57.060 --> 01:51:58.020
Monique Brammer, 23 years old.
A prostitute and an addict.

3506
01:51:58.060 --> 01:51:58.920
She went missing 13 months ago.

3507
01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:00.490
-Right.
-The investigation was inadequate.

3508
01:52:01.310 --> 01:52:02.810
-Don't you agree?
-Yes. It was terrible.

3509
01:52:02.850 --> 01:52:03.920
But we found blood traces
in her apartment.

3510
01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:05.310
The samples are on their way
and can be compared to the body.

3511
01:52:05.350 --> 01:52:06.540
Before the bodies were dumped,
the power was cut for 48 seconds.

3512
01:52:06.580 --> 01:52:07.560
Their trying to trace the signal.
Can you help them, Gry?

3513
01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:08.580
-How was it done?
-Someone accessed a computer.

3514
01:52:08.620 --> 01:52:09.060
Can you show me the fourth picture?

3515
01:52:09.490 --> 01:52:10.100
Use all the people you need. Gry?

3516
01:52:10.140 --> 01:52:11.480
Here's Ekwall's mobile number.
Get the phone records.

3517
01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:12.620
Check her computers.
Talk to John about passwords.

3518
01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:13.530
Anne?
Find out where she was abducted.

3519
01:52:13.570 --> 01:52:14.760
She left work half past six.
She had a car. Find it!

3520
01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:16.200
-Were they dumped from her car?
-No, a black Cadillac Escalade.

3521
01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:17.660
The image where the bridge
is seen from above.

3522
01:52:17.700 --> 01:52:19.020
-John can find the license number.
-What? Sure.

3523
01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:20.010
-What are you doing?
-I had an idea.

3524
01:52:20.050 --> 01:52:21.540
The orange line the body was on...
We discussed where she was.

3525
01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:22.390
Here's the Swedish-Danish border.

3526
01:52:22.430 --> 01:52:23.490
One half is in Sweden,
one is in Denmark.

3527
01:52:23.530 --> 01:52:24.600
-It's millimetre perfect.
-Tell me everything about the line.

3528
01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:25.230
Take paint samples.

3529
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:26.800
Power cut, body halves, a politician.
We'll be in the public eye.

3530
01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:36.810
-Hi. Is Veronika at home?
-Yes.

3531
01:52:36.850 --> 01:52:37.700
-What do you want?
-I would like to talk to her.

3532
01:52:37.740 --> 01:52:38.940
-You can talk to me.
-I would if you were clean.

3533
01:52:39.410 --> 01:52:40.120
-What? I am clean.
-Hi, Veronika.

3534
01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:41.600
-Isn't it enough to have us evicted?
-The landlord did that.

3535
01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:43.510
-You're not helping.
-I'm trying. I'm trying really hard.

3536
01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:45.010
If you had been more dependable,
you wouldn't have to move.

3537
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:47.440
-That was bloody stupid.
-Sören! Stop it!

3538
01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:50.040
What the hell?

3539
01:52:51.590 --> 01:52:52.320
Stop, you bastard!

3540
01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:54.830
Stop! Come out!

3541
01:52:57.650 --> 01:52:58.490
Sören! Stop it, Sören! Stop it!

3542
01:52:58.530 --> 01:52:59.410
-I hate that bloody bastard!
-Sören!

3543
01:52:59.850 --> 01:53:01.150
He's caused trouble all along.
It makes me so angry!

3544
01:53:01.190 --> 01:53:02.660
Let go of me.
Go to hell, you bloody idiots.

3545
01:53:12.410 --> 01:53:13.220
-How's the operation going?
-It hasn't started.

3546
01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:14.350
-Why? He was prepared hours ago.
-I don't know.

3547
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:15.080
I'm afraid I have to go.

3548
01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:16.610
-Don't you know where he is?
-You probably know better than me.

3549
01:53:16.650 --> 01:53:18.050
We'll call you if we hear from him...
Let's go.

3550
01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:19.780
-I'm sorry about all of this.
-Stop apologizing for him.

3551
01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:21.680
He's an adult
and makes his own decisions.

3552
01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:23.310
Maybe you should do the same?
Sören put you in this position.

3553
01:53:23.590 --> 01:53:24.890
You spend your money wisely,
but can't if you're not given any.

3554
01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:26.300
You don't get the chance
to care for your boys.

3555
01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:27.870
-He hits you and the children.
-Hardly ever the children.

3556
01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:28.900
Hardly ever? That's not good enough.

3557
01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:29.990
He shouldn't hit any of you.

3558
01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:31.940
You can get your life back on track.
Just you and the children.

3559
01:53:33.110 --> 01:53:33.980
Leave your husband
or nothing will change.

3560
01:53:34.750 --> 01:53:35.310
Think about it.

3561
01:53:38.340 --> 01:53:40.000
-Anders? What's going on?
-We've got a problem.

3562
01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:41.470
The donor was declared brain dead,
and a nurse spoke to his father.

3563
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:42.830
The father changed his mind.
We can't have the heart. Göran!

3564
01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:49.730
Wasn't that the turn-off?

3565
01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:51.440
-Stefan? Wasn't that the turn-off?
-No, not today.

3566
01:53:52.060 --> 01:53:53.090
-Where are we going?
-You'll see.

3567
01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:01.960
Johan was nicknamed "The old bag".
He died a month ago.

3568
01:54:02.230 --> 01:54:03.830
No wife, no children, no debts,
no assets. The house was all he had.

3569
01:54:04.130 --> 01:54:04.840
It went to the local council.

3570
01:54:07.590 --> 01:54:08.090
It's Sören.

3571
01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:10.020
Come.

3572
01:54:18.070 --> 01:54:19.200
-Step inside.
-What about the children?

3573
01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:19.920
They can stay outside a while longer.

3574
01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:22.810
-Where are we? Why are we here?
-Just go inside.

3575
01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:27.170
-Crime scene and meeting place.
-Have you worked here a long time?

3576
01:54:27.210 --> 01:54:27.760
-More than ten years?
-Yes.

3577
01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:28.880
-Are you from around here?
-From Malmö? No.

3578
01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:30.640
I'm from Copenhagen.
I was born there.

3579
01:54:31.230 --> 01:54:33.120
No wonder Ingmar Bergman
and Lars Norén are from Sweden.

3580
01:54:33.330 --> 01:54:34.390
-Are you related to Lars Norén?
-No.

3581
01:54:34.730 --> 01:54:35.630
We need to find the meeting place
and the crime scene.

3582
01:54:35.670 --> 01:54:36.850
Where did the perpetrator
meet the victim?

3583
01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:41.510
I've spoken to Copenhagen.
You'll cooperate on the deaths.

3584
01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:42.550
Here's info about your authority.

3585
01:54:42.590 --> 01:54:43.750
I know what applies to me
in Denmark.

3586
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:45.140
-Can I have a word with you, Saga?
-Yes.

3587
01:54:46.610 --> 01:54:47.530
The report you filed
against Martin...

3588
01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:48.200
Yes, there's only one.

3589
01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:49.210
What do you suggest I do with it?

3590
01:54:49.250 --> 01:54:50.210
Don't you think
it will affect your cooperation?

3591
01:54:50.490 --> 01:54:51.320
-Do you think so?
-I think there's every chance.

3592
01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:52.620
-Will he dislike me?
-That might happen.

3593
01:54:52.660 --> 01:54:54.180
Because of my report?
It doesn't have to affect the case.

3594
01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:55.220
He let an ambulance through.
No life was in danger.

3595
01:54:55.260 --> 01:54:56.230
-I'm supposed to file a report.
-I'll handle the report.

3596
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:57.890
-Yes, that's fine. Fine.
-I've got the car's license number.

3597
01:54:57.930 --> 01:54:58.740
It belongs to Daniel Farbé in Malmö.

3598
01:54:58.780 --> 01:54:59.650
-The journalist?
-Yes, he's a journalist.

3599
01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:02.880
-Do you know who he is?
-Yes. I read his column.

3600
01:55:03.610 --> 01:55:04.170
It's entertaining.

3601
01:55:17.670 --> 01:55:19.070
-You made me jump.
-I worked all night.

3602
01:55:19.110 --> 01:55:20.300
-I'm done for the week. Berlin next.
-You work all night.

3603
01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:21.200
Then you get down in Berlin.
How do you manage?

3604
01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:22.370
Get down?
How many children have you got?

3605
01:55:22.410 --> 01:55:23.290
Children that suck the life
out of you.

3606
01:55:23.330 --> 01:55:24.980
I haven't got children. No one says
"get down" any more. No one.

3607
01:55:25.620 --> 01:55:26.270
-Have fun.
-I will.

3608
01:55:26.310 --> 01:55:26.980
I downloaded
"Elephants in the Desert".

3609
01:55:27.460 --> 01:55:28.050
What do you want, Åke?

3610
01:55:28.090 --> 01:55:29.150
A hug, an award, an applause?
Would you like one?

3611
01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:30.890
-They're really cool. I like them.
-Yes, they were cool.

3612
01:55:30.930 --> 01:55:32.320
What?
Two weeks ago you really liked them.

3613
01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:32.910
And now you like them.

3614
01:55:33.450 --> 01:55:33.980
My daughter...

3615
01:55:35.130 --> 01:55:36.100
-She danced all afternoon.
-Sorry, I have to answer.

3616
01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:37.480
We'll have to continue this later.

3617
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:40.200
You and the boys will disappear.

3618
01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:41.100
Your paperwork
and your debts are gone.

3619
01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:42.840
You can make a fresh start.
Do you understand?

3620
01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:45.030
You can make a fresh start.
There's cash and a mobile here.

3621
01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:46.710
But you can never see or talk to
your husband again.

3622
01:55:47.250 --> 01:55:48.310
He's their dad.
I have to let them see him.

3623
01:55:48.350 --> 01:55:49.390
Why? Why do they have to?

3624
01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:51.630
To get another beating?
To be scared and broke?

3625
01:55:51.670 --> 01:55:53.190
Let him spend everything on drugs?
He'll ruin everything for you again.

3626
01:55:53.550 --> 01:55:54.250
People like him ruin things.

3627
01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:55.920
You don't know me.
Why are you doing this?

3628
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.980
Because I can.

3629
01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:10.940
Bloody hell.

3630
01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:20.010
-Here's my car.
-Do you think it's him?

3631
01:56:20.050 --> 01:56:21.270
He kept a body in a freezer
and killed a politician.

3632
01:56:21.310 --> 01:56:22.360
-He wouldn't use his own car.
-Nice car.

3633
01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:23.660
-Is the Swedish police paid well?
-No, the same as in Denmark.

3634
01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:25.090
Don't jump to conclusions
about my wages based on my car.

3635
01:56:25.130 --> 01:56:26.380
Maybe it was a gift?
Maybe I inherited it or had savings?

3636
01:56:26.420 --> 01:56:27.650
I hope your professional conclusions
are more valid.

3637
01:56:27.690 --> 01:56:28.940
Read this.
It's Daniel Ferbé's latest column.

3638
01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:30.230
-The one that's a good writer?
-No, I said he's entertaining.

3639
01:56:30.270 --> 01:56:30.900
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

3640
01:56:43.470 --> 01:56:44.630
Hello? What's going on?

3641
01:56:44.670 --> 01:56:45.980
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-A Cadillac has a bomb in it.

3642
01:56:46.020 --> 01:56:47.020
Is it a black Escalade?
It's tied to a double homicide.

3643
01:56:47.060 --> 01:56:48.550
-Is the guy trying to kill himself?
-I don't think he was involved.

3644
01:56:48.590 --> 01:56:49.880
No, you're not going
anywhere near the place.

3645
01:56:57.390 --> 01:56:58.400
Help! Help!

3646
01:56:58.590 --> 01:56:59.290
-Take it easy.
-Please help me!

3647
01:56:59.330 --> 01:57:00.450
-Help me! Get me out!
-Calm down.

3648
01:57:02.250 --> 01:57:02.990
-Help me!
-The windshield is wired in.

3649
01:57:03.030 --> 01:57:03.980
The side windows are
connected to the electrical system.

3650
01:57:04.020 --> 01:57:05.410
The glass seems OK,
but there are wires everywhere.

3651
01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:08.050
We've got his contact details.

3652
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:13.340
-What's going on?
-My mobile!

3653
01:57:13.380 --> 01:57:14.580
-Yes?
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

3654
01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:15.990
I need to know whether you were
on the bridge last night.

3655
01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:17.090
-What?
-Were you on the Öresund Bridge?

3656
01:57:17.130 --> 01:57:18.200
I was working.
I was here all the time.

3657
01:57:18.570 --> 01:57:19.570
-How will you get me out?
-I don't know, that's not my job.

3658
01:57:19.610 --> 01:57:20.680
-Do you know Kerstin Ekwall?
-Who?

3659
01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:21.610
Daniel? Did you do anything
apart from turn the key?

3660
01:57:21.650 --> 01:57:22.990
No. Everything locked.
The countdown started.

3661
01:57:23.030 --> 01:57:23.820
-Hello?
-I'm talking to the bomb guy.

3662
01:57:23.860 --> 01:57:24.630
Chairman of the City Council
Kerstin Ekwall.

3663
01:57:24.670 --> 01:57:26.120
-Have you written about her?
-No, I don't know.

3664
01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:27.240
-Have you been tipped off about her?
-No! What is this?

3665
01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:27.940
Get me out! Please!

3666
01:57:27.980 --> 01:57:29.100
Does anyone else
have a key to your car?

3667
01:57:29.140 --> 01:57:30.540
-No, I don't know.
-Can you reach it?

3668
01:57:30.580 --> 01:57:31.460
I don't want to die. Please.

3669
01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:32.780
-I don't want it to end like this.
-Daniel? You need to talk to me.

3670
01:57:33.970 --> 01:57:35.360
It skipped a minute.
What the hell did you do?

3671
01:57:35.570 --> 01:57:37.150
It was three, now it's two.
It was three.

3672
01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:38.570
Come one, hurry up.

3673
01:57:38.610 --> 01:57:39.870
Where are you going?
Stay here! Please!

3674
01:57:40.470 --> 01:57:42.060
Please! Come back!
Where are you going?

3675
01:57:45.330 --> 01:57:46.710
You need to talk to me.
Daniel? Daniel?

3676
01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:47.680
Is it a big bomb?

3677
01:57:48.620 --> 01:57:49.780
-I think so.
-You're not religious, right?

3678
01:57:49.820 --> 01:57:50.490
You're an atheist?

3679
01:57:50.530 --> 01:57:52.050
Everything will just stop. The body
won't have time to register pain.

3680
01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:54.580
-Are you sure?
-Don't look at the clock. Listen.

3681
01:57:54.620 --> 01:57:56.020
Do you know why your car
was used to dump two bodies?

3682
01:57:56.700 --> 01:57:57.510
-No.
-Think about it. Focus.

3683
01:57:57.550 --> 01:57:58.930
-Who did this to you?
-I've slagged so many people off.

3684
01:58:02.090 --> 01:58:03.150
Daniel? Are you still there? Hello?

3685
01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:10.520
It's clean.

3686
01:58:12.420 --> 01:58:13.580
Sorry about the drama, it's hard
to make oneself heard today.

3687
01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:14.400
I assume I have your attention now.

3688
01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:16.040
Our part of the world would be
wonderful if we solved our problems.

3689
01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:16.910
I would like to
point out five in particular.

3690
01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:18.570
This is only a beginning. We've got
interesting times ahead of us.

3691
01:58:18.570 --> 01:58:19.470
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-Copenhagen Police.

3692
01:58:19.510 --> 01:58:20.200
-Do you know who she is?
-Yes.

3693
01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:22.160
Excuse me. A woman insists on
speaking to the person in charge.

3694
01:58:22.610 --> 01:58:23.700
-Is she in Sweden or Denmark?
-I don't know.

3695
01:58:23.970 --> 01:58:25.370
She's Swedish, and the car came
from Sweden. I assume I'm in charge.

3696
01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:27.900
-Saga Norén. Can I help you?
-When will you let traffic through?

3697
01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:29.000
-It might take up to two hours.
-I haven't got two hours!

3698
01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:29.800
-Back up.
-Is someone's life in danger?

3699
01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:30.610
There's a heart for my husband
in Copenhagen.

3700
01:58:30.650 --> 01:58:31.730
He needs a heart transplant.
Let us through.

3701
01:58:31.770 --> 01:58:32.720
He'll have to wait.
I can't let anyone through.

3702
01:58:33.090 --> 01:58:34.210
-What's happened?
-Is there no other way through?

3703
01:58:34.250 --> 01:58:35.250
There ought to be
another way through.

3704
01:58:35.290 --> 01:58:36.740
-No one's answering any questions.
-Let me pass, please.

3705
01:58:39.270 --> 01:58:40.580
The Öresund Bridge to Denmark
is closed.

3706
01:58:40.620 --> 01:58:41.500
According to the police it will...

3707
01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:47.420
-It's Stefan Lindberg.
-Hi, it's Veronika.

3708
01:58:47.460 --> 01:58:48.840
-Sorry, did I wake you up?
-No, you didn't. How are you?

3709
01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:50.070
I can't sleep.
I've got a stomach ache.

3710
01:58:50.110 --> 01:58:51.170
-I see. How are the boys?
-They're asleep.

3711
01:58:51.210 --> 01:58:52.250
They don't understand
what's about to happen.

3712
01:58:52.290 --> 01:58:53.570
-Can we meet up?
-Now?

3713
01:58:54.190 --> 01:58:55.040
Of course.
Do you want me to come over?

3714
01:58:55.470 --> 01:58:56.880
-No. I'd rather go to your place.
-OK.

3715
01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:57.860
-I can go to the office.
-I'll see you there.

3716
01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:01.510
Give me everything from
when the car came on to the bridge.

3717
01:59:01.550 --> 01:59:02.780
One camera records at a time.
They're started manually.

3718
01:59:02.820 --> 01:59:03.680
My colleague
might have recorded something.

3719
01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:04.750
Hello! Stop! Stop!

3720
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:06.130
-Stop! Stop!
-I allowed it.

3721
01:59:06.170 --> 01:59:07.440
-Why? This is a crime scene.
-I'm fully aware of that.

3722
01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:08.230
-We've got enough bodies.
-He wasn't dying.

3723
01:59:08.270 --> 01:59:09.290
-Are you a doctor?
-No, I'm a police officer.

3724
01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:11.050
-What's your name?
-Martin Rohde.

3725
01:59:11.090 --> 01:59:11.990
-Rohde?
-R, O, H, D, E.

3726
01:59:12.030 --> 01:59:13.710
-Have you got an ID?
-It was an ambulance.

3727
01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:14.940
The Chairman
of Malmö City Council is dead.

3728
01:59:14.980 --> 01:59:16.280
-What evidence was destroyed?
-Probably none.

3729
01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:16.830
Thank you.

3730
01:59:23.270 --> 01:59:24.120
Hello. Hi. Finally.

3731
01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:25.570
I wont operate on Göran, Charlotte.
I had wine with my dinner.

3732
01:59:25.890 --> 01:59:27.460
-At what time? Are you drunk?
-No, but that doesn't matter.

3733
01:59:27.800 --> 01:59:28.780
You promised to see us through this.

3734
01:59:28.820 --> 01:59:29.900
-Morten Krag is a very good surgeon.
-Better than you?

3735
01:59:29.940 --> 01:59:30.810
I'll decide
who my husband's surgeon is!

3736
01:59:30.850 --> 01:59:32.320
-I wont forgive you if it goes wrong.
-What if I do it and it goes wrong?

3737
01:59:32.990 --> 01:59:33.880
Then I'll never forgive myself.

3738
01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:38.990
-We're done, you can move her.
-You can take her away.

3739
01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:41.610
Bloody hell.

3740
01:59:45.950 --> 01:59:47.100
The autopsy on Kerstin Ekwall
is being performed.

3741
01:59:47.140 --> 01:59:48.060
-And the recordings?
-They'll deliver them tomorrow.

3742
01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:48.860
-What about the press?
-They know.

3743
01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:49.960
The radio said that it was a woman.
They don't know who it is.

3744
01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:51.280
-And the family?
-I'm on my way to see them.

3745
01:59:51.320 --> 01:59:52.810
You'll wake them up, and there
are children there. Tread lightly.

3746
01:59:52.850 --> 01:59:54.400
In what sense? Oh. There aren't
that many ways to say it.

3747
01:59:54.440 --> 01:59:55.200
-Just tread lightly.
-Listen, Hans...

3748
01:59:55.240 --> 01:59:55.940
She was chopped in half.

3749
01:59:55.980 --> 01:59:57.050
-Right above the hips.
-What the hell are you saying?

3750
01:59:57.670 --> 01:59:59.130
She was due to attend a conference
in Copenhagen this morning.

3751
01:59:59.430 --> 02:00:00.490
-Have you got more computers?
-No.

3752
02:00:00.530 --> 02:00:01.420
Are you taking them?
The children's as well?

3753
02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:02.600
-When did you last talk to her?
-She called yesterday.

3754
02:00:02.820 --> 02:00:03.650
-Do you know what time it was?
-I don't know.

3755
02:00:03.880 --> 02:00:04.720
Around half past six in the evening.

3756
02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:05.560
-Was she threatened?
-By whom?

3757
02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:06.370
I didn't say that she was,
I asked you.

3758
02:00:06.650 --> 02:00:08.310
Not really. She was a politician,
there were some calls and emails.

3759
02:00:08.350 --> 02:00:09.800
-Has she upset anyone lately?
-Lately...

3760
02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:11.040
She wanted to charge for
library loans. Some disapproved.

3761
02:00:11.290 --> 02:00:12.060
-That's foolish.
-Sorry, what?

3762
02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:13.700
Reading becomes a money matter.
Social differences will grow.

3763
02:00:13.740 --> 02:00:14.660
-Is that why she was...?
-We don't know why.

3764
02:00:14.700 --> 02:00:15.440
It's unlikely
that library fees caused it.

3765
02:00:15.810 --> 02:00:16.690
Why? Why did someone do this?

3766
02:00:16.730 --> 02:00:18.380
Can you think of something personal?
Was she in debt? Did she use drugs?

3767
02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:19.150
Did she have an affair?

3768
02:00:22.970 --> 02:00:23.560
Saga Norén.

3769
02:00:24.030 --> 02:00:24.630
Can't we talk on the phone?

3770
02:00:25.170 --> 02:00:26.100
I'll be there in twenty minutes. Bye.

3771
02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:38.020
August?

3772
02:00:51.070 --> 02:00:51.860
-Were you on the bridge?
-Yes.

3773
02:00:51.900 --> 02:00:52.920
-What happened?
-A murder, the Swedes will handle it.

3774
02:00:53.190 --> 02:00:53.770
-Did you check on August?
-Yes.

3775
02:00:53.810 --> 02:00:54.690
-Is he asleep?
-Yes.

3776
02:00:54.730 --> 02:00:55.800
You promised to talk to him.
He's become a night owl.

3777
02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:56.610
Do you want me to
wake him up now?

3778
02:00:56.900 --> 02:00:58.240
-He got up at three o'clock today.
-I'll have a word with him tomorrow.

3779
02:01:01.230 --> 02:01:02.360
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

3780
02:01:08.130 --> 02:01:09.600
-Do you know the cause of death?
-I can make a qualified guess.

3781
02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:10.580
She died six to eight hours ago.

3782
02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:11.870
Yes, she called home at six thirty
and was dumped just after midnight.

3783
02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:13.090
There's something else.

3784
02:01:13.130 --> 02:01:13.770
-What?
-Take a look.

3785
02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:22.550
No livor mortis on the ears.
That's consistent with the bleeding.

3786
02:01:22.590 --> 02:01:23.300
Petechiae on the conjunctivas.

3787
02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:24.680
The face is swollen.

3788
02:01:25.770 --> 02:01:26.760
She was strangled
and cut in half after death.

3789
02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:27.560
And the other half?

3790
02:01:28.990 --> 02:01:30.180
The lower body is much paler.
A lot paler.

3791
02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:32.040
It's not coherent with the bleeding
or how the body was placed.

3792
02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:34.260
There's brown discoloration.
Frostbite?

3793
02:01:34.530 --> 02:01:35.680
It feels different. Frostbite.

3794
02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:36.440
Not frostbite, deep-freezing.

3795
02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:37.670
For about a year, I think.
I've never seen anything like this.

3796
02:01:37.710 --> 02:01:38.960
I don't know who they belong to.
They're not Kerstin Ekwall's legs.

3797
02:01:44.660 --> 02:01:45.540
-So everyone's here, then.
-Yes.

3798
02:01:45.580 --> 02:01:46.080
Hi, Sebastian.

3799
02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:47.900
I don't know what to do.

3800
02:01:47.940 --> 02:01:48.980
I'm worried about tomorrow.
I had to see you.

3801
02:01:49.020 --> 02:01:49.790
Can't you just pay the rent?

3802
02:01:49.830 --> 02:01:51.270
They can't evict the children.
Can they? Their friends are there.

3803
02:01:51.310 --> 02:01:52.110
I paid out money for the rent.

3804
02:01:52.690 --> 02:01:53.660
-Why did you bring the children?
-Sören wasn't there.

3805
02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:54.670
I can't manage.

3806
02:01:54.870 --> 02:01:56.080
-Can't you make an exception?
-No. You know I can't.

3807
02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:57.090
-Please.
-There are guidelines. I'm sorry.

3808
02:02:01.260 --> 02:02:02.540
Charlotte Söringer? I'm Frederik
Henriksen, hospital administrator.

3809
02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:04.420
-Göran had atrial fibrillation.
-They managed to stop it.

3810
02:02:04.460 --> 02:02:05.500
-He's to weak for surgery.
-Too weak?

3811
02:02:05.540 --> 02:02:06.720
-But there's a new heart.
-It will be given to someone else.

3812
02:02:07.090 --> 02:02:08.060
Anders said
that you need a new CT scanner.

3813
02:02:08.100 --> 02:02:09.680
My husband's business is doing well.
He's willing to donate a CT scanner.

3814
02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:10.490
We're cancelling for his own sake.

3815
02:02:10.530 --> 02:02:11.850
He'll die without a new heart.
I want both parties to benefit.

3816
02:02:11.890 --> 02:02:13.530
Pass my offer on
to the proper authority, please.

3817
02:02:19.170 --> 02:02:19.870
-Hello? Is this Martin Rohde?
-Yes.

3818
02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:21.040
-It's Saga Norén from the bridge.
-Yes, I remember.

3819
02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:22.730
-Were you asleep?
-I tend to doze off around this time.

3820
02:02:22.770 --> 02:02:23.620
-There were two women.
-You found another one.

3821
02:02:23.660 --> 02:02:24.590
The lower body
belonged to someone else.

3822
02:02:24.630 --> 02:02:25.890
-Have you found half a body?
-I don't know.

3823
02:02:25.930 --> 02:02:27.420
It could be more than a year ago.
The legs have been deep-frozen.

3824
02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:28.620
-Can you look into it? Now?
-First thing tomorrow morning.

3825
02:02:28.890 --> 02:02:29.840
Can someone else
look into it straight away?

3826
02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:31.570
-I'll call you back.
-When?

3827
02:02:33.460 --> 02:02:34.100
-Do you have to get up?
-Yes.

3828
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:42.100
Missing woman, Caucasian,
at least a year ago...

3829
02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:42.800
-How old?
-Adult.

3830
02:02:43.050 --> 02:02:43.840
-And life in general is OK?
-Yes.

3831
02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:44.560
-What about you?
-I'm fine.

3832
02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:46.380
-So you'll be firing blanks.
-Was it in the staff news bulletin?

3833
02:02:46.420 --> 02:02:47.820
-Is everything working as it should?
-It will in time.

3834
02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:48.500
It can't be much fun.

3835
02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:49.730
-What do you mean?
-You've heard about castrated toms?

3836
02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:51.430
A wild predator turns into
a chunky sleepyhead. Just like that.

3837
02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:53.320
They're castrated,
that's not the same thing.

3838
02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:54.490
Let's see what we've got.

3839
02:02:55.170 --> 02:02:55.790
Two women killed a year apart.

3840
02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:57.040
One was deep-frozen.
They were dismembered.

3841
02:02:57.080 --> 02:02:58.700
And assembled on the bridge.
Someone wants to make a statement.

3842
02:03:00.830 --> 02:03:01.470
-Saga Norén.
-It's Martin.

3843
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:02.970
The lower body is Monique Brammer,
I think. A missing 23-year-old.

3844
02:03:03.010 --> 02:03:03.780
-Can you email the info?
-I'll be right over.

3845
02:03:03.820 --> 02:03:04.800
-Why do you want to come here?
-She's Danish.

3846
02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:06.010
I was first on the scene.
Everyone's still asleep here.

3847
02:03:06.050 --> 02:03:06.880
-Do you mind if I come over?
-Yes.

3848
02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:08.040
Make sure I'm allowed in.
You've got my details.

3849
02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:09.920
Martin Rohde has probably identified
the second body. He's coming over.

3850
02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:11.090
-Is that a problem?
-Yes...

3851
02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:11.960
No, no.

3852
02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:13.450
If half of the body is Danish,
we have to cooperate.

3853
02:03:13.490 --> 02:03:14.220
I'll schedule a meeting
at half past five.

3854
02:03:14.260 --> 02:03:15.220
-Can you be ready by then?
-Yes.

3855
02:03:22.230 --> 02:03:22.800
It finally worked out.

3856
02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:26.290
-What did you just sign?
-Formalities.

3857
02:03:26.890 --> 02:03:27.950
-Whose is it?
-What?

3858
02:03:27.990 --> 02:03:28.580
The heart. Whose is it?

3859
02:03:28.620 --> 02:03:29.670
A man's. He's 25 or 26
and had a motorcycle accident.

3860
02:03:30.550 --> 02:03:31.890
-What's his name?
-I don't know. Does it matter?

3861
02:03:32.580 --> 02:03:33.560
No, I guess it doesn't.

3862
02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:35.870
-I'm scared.
-It will be fine.

3863
02:03:36.290 --> 02:03:37.650
Anders will operate, they're all
highly skilled. It will be fine.

3864
02:03:37.930 --> 02:03:38.580
I can't imagine life without you.

3865
02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:41.080
-I need to take Göran with me.
-Don't worry. You'll make it, honey.

3866
02:03:42.230 --> 02:03:42.840
-Hi.
-Hi.

3867
02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:43.680
-Hi! An early breakfast?
-No thank you.

3868
02:03:43.720 --> 02:03:45.090
-An email would have been faster.
-Yes, but not as pleasant.

3869
02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:46.850
-Where are you going?
-I'm coming in with you.

3870
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:49.080
If it really is Monique Brammer,
we both have responsibilities.

3871
02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:50.800
Go straight on,
turn left, and register.

3872
02:03:53.470 --> 02:03:55.050
-Good morning. Coffee?
-No thanks, I've already had some.

3873
02:03:55.090 --> 02:03:56.420
I'm Martin Rohde.
I'll be working with Saga.

3874
02:03:56.460 --> 02:03:57.990
-Thank you. You need to register.
-I also need a card.

3875
02:03:58.030 --> 02:03:58.780
-My name's Felicia.
-Nice to meet you.

3876
02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:00.140
-That's it. This is for you.
-Thank you.

3877
02:04:00.180 --> 02:04:01.440
-And one of these is for you.
-Thanks! Ooh, Danish.

3878
02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:03.100
-See you later.
-I hope so.

3879
02:04:05.470 --> 02:04:06.960
-Where's Saga Norén?
-To the right. Bye!

3880
02:04:10.220 --> 02:04:10.840
Excuse me.

3881
02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:11.690
-Sit down.
-I'm afraid I can't.

3882
02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:14.210
-You make me nervous.
-OK, I can stand still.

3883
02:04:14.250 --> 02:04:15.530
-Why can't you sit down?
-My nether regions hurt.

3884
02:04:15.980 --> 02:04:17.330
-I had a vasectomy yesterday.
-Right.

3885
02:04:17.370 --> 02:04:18.200
I've got five children
with three different women.

3886
02:04:18.550 --> 02:04:19.550
-Have you got children?
-No, why would I want to?

3887
02:04:19.590 --> 02:04:20.660
-I've never heard anyone ask that.
-Many should have.

3888
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:22.840
Not you,
I'm sure you're a wonderful dad.

3889
02:04:25.220 --> 02:04:26.520
-Why aren't you off sick?
-I can't afford it. August moved in.

3890
02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:28.310
Well, it's not really about money.
It was a small procedure, I can work.

3891
02:04:28.350 --> 02:04:29.210
-You can't sit down.
-I can.

3892
02:04:29.250 --> 02:04:30.320
-I drove here.
-Pretend that the chair is a car.

3893
02:04:32.070 --> 02:04:32.570
Yes.

3894
02:04:35.110 --> 02:04:36.180
-No one wanted to solve the case.
-What do you mean?

3895
02:04:36.220 --> 02:04:37.060
Monique Brammer
was reported missing.

3896
02:04:37.100 --> 02:04:38.590
Two prostitutes and a neighbour were
interviewed. The case was shelved.

3897
02:04:38.830 --> 02:04:39.490
It fell between two stools.

3898
02:04:39.530 --> 02:04:40.770
She disappeared, or she was killed.
They didn't find a body.

3899
02:04:41.190 --> 02:04:41.920
The case was
supposed to be shelved.

3900
02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:43.140
I'm surprised it took two weeks.
Come with me.

3901
02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:47.540
Do you think I should?
I tried painkillers, but...

3902
02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:49.110
-Two computers?
-They know who it is now.

3903
02:04:49.150 --> 02:04:49.910
-Will Saga handle the case, Hans?
-Yes.

3904
02:04:49.950 --> 02:04:50.840
-That's good.
-And a Danish police officer.

3905
02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:52.630
-Does he know that she's a bit odd?
-If not, he'll soon find out.

3906
02:04:54.050 --> 02:04:54.990
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

3907
02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:56.240
-This is Martin Röhde.
-It's Rohde.

3908
02:04:56.280 --> 02:04:57.540
Not as when you say "fur".
Rohde, Foure...

3909
02:04:58.410 --> 02:04:59.530
-Have you read the file?
-Most people have just arrived.

3910
02:04:59.570 --> 02:05:00.600
Half of two female bodies were found.
One was Kerstin Ekwall.

3911
02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:01.380
The other one has been deep-frozen.
Martin?

3912
02:05:01.420 --> 02:05:02.740
It's probably the 23-year-old
Monique Brammer from Copenhagen.

3913
02:05:02.780 --> 02:05:03.960
A prostitute and an addict
that went missing 13 months ago.

3914
02:05:04.610 --> 02:05:05.600
Do you want me to repeat that?
A bit slower?

3915
02:05:05.790 --> 02:05:06.750
Monique Brammer, 23 years old.
A prostitute and an addict.

3916
02:05:06.790 --> 02:05:07.650
She went missing 13 months ago.

3917
02:05:07.690 --> 02:05:09.220
-Right.
-The investigation was inadequate.

3918
02:05:10.040 --> 02:05:11.540
-Don't you agree?
-Yes. It was terrible.

3919
02:05:11.580 --> 02:05:12.650
But we found blood traces
in her apartment.

3920
02:05:12.690 --> 02:05:14.040
The samples are on their way
and can be compared to the body.

3921
02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:15.270
Before the bodies were dumped,
the power was cut for 48 seconds.

3922
02:05:15.310 --> 02:05:16.290
Their trying to trace the signal.
Can you help them, Gry?

3923
02:05:16.330 --> 02:05:17.310
-How was it done?
-Someone accessed a computer.

3924
02:05:17.350 --> 02:05:17.790
Can you show me the fourth picture?

3925
02:05:18.220 --> 02:05:18.830
Use all the people you need. Gry?

3926
02:05:18.870 --> 02:05:20.210
Here's Ekwall's mobile number.
Get the phone records.

3927
02:05:20.250 --> 02:05:21.350
Check her computers.
Talk to John about passwords.

3928
02:05:21.390 --> 02:05:22.260
Anne?
Find out where she was abducted.

3929
02:05:22.300 --> 02:05:23.490
She left work half past six.
She had a car. Find it!

3930
02:05:23.530 --> 02:05:24.930
-Were they dumped from her car?
-No, a black Cadillac Escalade.

3931
02:05:24.970 --> 02:05:26.390
The image where the bridge
is seen from above.

3932
02:05:26.430 --> 02:05:27.750
-John can find the license number.
-What? Sure.

3933
02:05:27.790 --> 02:05:28.740
-What are you doing?
-I had an idea.

3934
02:05:28.780 --> 02:05:30.270
The orange line the body was on...
We discussed where she was.

3935
02:05:30.310 --> 02:05:31.120
Here's the Swedish-Danish border.

3936
02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:32.220
One half is in Sweden,
one is in Denmark.

3937
02:05:32.260 --> 02:05:33.330
-It's millimetre perfect.
-Tell me everything about the line.

3938
02:05:33.370 --> 02:05:33.960
Take paint samples.

3939
02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:35.530
Power cut, body halves, a politician.
We'll be in the public eye.

3940
02:05:44.050 --> 02:05:45.540
-Hi. Is Veronika at home?
-Yes.

3941
02:05:45.580 --> 02:05:46.430
-What do you want?
-I would like to talk to her.

3942
02:05:46.470 --> 02:05:47.670
-You can talk to me.
-I would if you were clean.

3943
02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:48.850
-What? I am clean.
-Hi, Veronika.

3944
02:05:48.890 --> 02:05:50.330
-Isn't it enough to have us evicted?
-The landlord did that.

3945
02:05:50.760 --> 02:05:52.240
-You're not helping.
-I'm trying. I'm trying really hard.

3946
02:05:52.280 --> 02:05:53.740
If you had been more dependable,
you wouldn't have to move.

3947
02:05:54.720 --> 02:05:56.170
-That was bloody stupid.
-Sören! Stop it!

3948
02:05:58.270 --> 02:05:58.770
What the hell?

3949
02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:01.050
Stop, you bastard!

3950
02:06:02.970 --> 02:06:03.560
Stop! Come out!

3951
02:06:06.380 --> 02:06:07.220
Sören! Stop it, Sören! Stop it!

3952
02:06:07.260 --> 02:06:08.140
-I hate that bloody bastard!
-Sören!

3953
02:06:08.580 --> 02:06:09.880
He's caused trouble all along.
It makes me so angry!

3954
02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:11.390
Let go of me.
Go to hell, you bloody idiots.

3955
02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:21.950
-How's the operation going?
-It hasn't started.

3956
02:06:21.990 --> 02:06:23.080
-Why? He was prepared hours ago.
-I don't know.

3957
02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:23.810
I'm afraid I have to go.

3958
02:06:23.850 --> 02:06:25.340
-Don't you know where he is?
-You probably know better than me.

3959
02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:26.780
We'll call you if we hear from him...
Let's go.

3960
02:06:27.290 --> 02:06:28.510
-I'm sorry about all of this.
-Stop apologizing for him.

3961
02:06:29.240 --> 02:06:30.410
He's an adult
and makes his own decisions.

3962
02:06:30.450 --> 02:06:32.040
Maybe you should do the same?
Sören put you in this position.

3963
02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:33.620
You spend your money wisely,
but can't if you're not given any.

3964
02:06:34.110 --> 02:06:35.030
You don't get the chance
to care for your boys.

3965
02:06:35.550 --> 02:06:36.600
-He hits you and the children.
-Hardly ever the children.

3966
02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:37.630
Hardly ever? That's not good enough.

3967
02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:38.720
He shouldn't hit any of you.

3968
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:40.670
You can get your life back on track.
Just you and the children.

3969
02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:42.710
Leave your husband
or nothing will change.

3970
02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:44.040
Think about it.

3971
02:06:47.070 --> 02:06:48.730
-Anders? What's going on?
-We've got a problem.

3972
02:06:48.770 --> 02:06:50.200
The donor was declared brain dead,
and a nurse spoke to his father.

3973
02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:51.560
The father changed his mind.
We can't have the heart. Göran!

3974
02:06:57.830 --> 02:06:58.460
Wasn't that the turn-off?

3975
02:06:59.030 --> 02:07:00.170
-Stefan? Wasn't that the turn-off?
-No, not today.

3976
02:07:00.790 --> 02:07:01.820
-Where are we going?
-You'll see.

3977
02:07:09.090 --> 02:07:10.690
Johan was nicknamed "The old bag".
He died a month ago.

3978
02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:12.560
No wife, no children, no debts,
no assets. The house was all he had.

3979
02:07:12.860 --> 02:07:13.570
It went to the local council.

3980
02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:16.820
It's Sören.

3981
02:07:18.250 --> 02:07:18.750
Come.

3982
02:07:26.800 --> 02:07:27.930
-Step inside.
-What about the children?

3983
02:07:27.970 --> 02:07:28.650
They can stay outside a while longer.

3984
02:07:30.090 --> 02:07:31.540
-Where are we? Why are we here?
-Just go inside.

3985
02:07:34.450 --> 02:07:35.900
-Crime scene and meeting place.
-Have you worked here a long time?

3986
02:07:35.940 --> 02:07:36.490
-More than ten years?
-Yes.

3987
02:07:36.530 --> 02:07:37.610
-Are you from around here?
-From Malmö? No.

3988
02:07:37.650 --> 02:07:39.370
I'm from Copenhagen.
I was born there.

3989
02:07:39.960 --> 02:07:41.850
No wonder Ingmar Bergman
and Lars Norén are from Sweden.

3990
02:07:42.060 --> 02:07:43.120
-Are you related to Lars Norén?
-No.

3991
02:07:43.460 --> 02:07:44.360
We need to find the meeting place
and the crime scene.

3992
02:07:44.400 --> 02:07:45.580
Where did the perpetrator
meet the victim?

3993
02:07:49.010 --> 02:07:50.240
I've spoken to Copenhagen.
You'll cooperate on the deaths.

3994
02:07:50.450 --> 02:07:51.280
Here's info about your authority.

3995
02:07:51.320 --> 02:07:52.480
I know what applies to me
in Denmark.

3996
02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:53.870
-Can I have a word with you, Saga?
-Yes.

3997
02:07:55.340 --> 02:07:56.260
The report you filed
against Martin...

3998
02:07:56.300 --> 02:07:56.930
Yes, there's only one.

3999
02:07:56.970 --> 02:07:57.940
What do you suggest I do with it?

4000
02:07:57.980 --> 02:07:58.940
Don't you think
it will affect your cooperation?

4001
02:07:59.220 --> 02:08:00.050
-Do you think so?
-I think there's every chance.

4002
02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:01.350
-Will he dislike me?
-That might happen.

4003
02:08:01.390 --> 02:08:02.910
Because of my report?
It doesn't have to affect the case.

4004
02:08:02.950 --> 02:08:03.950
He let an ambulance through.
No life was in danger.

4005
02:08:03.990 --> 02:08:04.960
-I'm supposed to file a report.
-I'll handle the report.

4006
02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:06.620
-Yes, that's fine. Fine.
-I've got the car's license number.

4007
02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:07.470
It belongs to Daniel Farbé in Malmö.

4008
02:08:07.510 --> 02:08:08.380
-The journalist?
-Yes, he's a journalist.

4009
02:08:10.330 --> 02:08:11.610
-Do you know who he is?
-Yes. I read his column.

4010
02:08:12.340 --> 02:08:12.900
It's entertaining.

4011
02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:27.800
-You made me jump.
-I worked all night.

4012
02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:29.030
-I'm done for the week. Berlin next.
-You work all night.

4013
02:08:29.070 --> 02:08:29.930
Then you get down in Berlin.
How do you manage?

4014
02:08:29.970 --> 02:08:31.100
Get down?
How many children have you got?

4015
02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:32.020
Children that suck the life
out of you.

4016
02:08:32.060 --> 02:08:33.710
I haven't got children. No one says
"get down" any more. No one.

4017
02:08:34.350 --> 02:08:35.000
-Have fun.
-I will.

4018
02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:35.710
I downloaded
"Elephants in the Desert".

4019
02:08:36.190 --> 02:08:36.780
What do you want, Åke?

4020
02:08:36.820 --> 02:08:37.880
A hug, an award, an applause?
Would you like one?

4021
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:39.620
-They're really cool. I like them.
-Yes, they were cool.

4022
02:08:39.660 --> 02:08:41.050
What?
Two weeks ago you really liked them.

4023
02:08:41.090 --> 02:08:41.640
And now you like them.

4024
02:08:42.180 --> 02:08:42.710
My daughter...

4025
02:08:43.860 --> 02:08:44.830
-She danced all afternoon.
-Sorry, I have to answer.

4026
02:08:45.370 --> 02:08:46.210
We'll have to continue this later.

4027
02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:48.930
You and the boys will disappear.

4028
02:08:48.970 --> 02:08:49.830
Your paperwork
and your debts are gone.

4029
02:08:50.410 --> 02:08:51.570
You can make a fresh start.
Do you understand?

4030
02:08:52.010 --> 02:08:53.760
You can make a fresh start.
There's cash and a mobile here.

4031
02:08:54.250 --> 02:08:55.440
But you can never see or talk to
your husband again.

4032
02:08:55.980 --> 02:08:57.040
He's their dad.
I have to let them see him.

4033
02:08:57.080 --> 02:08:58.120
Why? Why do they have to?

4034
02:08:58.790 --> 02:09:00.360
To get another beating?
To be scared and broke?

4035
02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:01.920
Let him spend everything on drugs?
He'll ruin everything for you again.

4036
02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:02.980
People like him ruin things.

4037
02:09:03.720 --> 02:09:04.650
You don't know me.
Why are you doing this?

4038
02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:07.710
Because I can.

4039
02:09:19.170 --> 02:09:19.670
Bloody hell.

4040
02:09:27.870 --> 02:09:28.740
-Here's my car.
-Do you think it's him?

4041
02:09:28.780 --> 02:09:30.000
He kept a body in a freezer
and killed a politician.

4042
02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:31.090
-He wouldn't use his own car.
-Nice car.

4043
02:09:31.130 --> 02:09:32.390
-Is the Swedish police paid well?
-No, the same as in Denmark.

4044
02:09:32.430 --> 02:09:33.820
Don't jump to conclusions
about my wages based on my car.

4045
02:09:33.860 --> 02:09:35.110
Maybe it was a gift?
Maybe I inherited it or had savings?

4046
02:09:35.150 --> 02:09:36.380
I hope your professional conclusions
are more valid.

4047
02:09:36.420 --> 02:09:37.670
Read this.
It's Daniel Ferbé's latest column.

4048
02:09:37.710 --> 02:09:38.960
-The one that's a good writer?
-No, I said he's entertaining.

4049
02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:39.630
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

4050
02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:53.360
Hello? What's going on?

4051
02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:54.710
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-A Cadillac has a bomb in it.

4052
02:09:54.750 --> 02:09:55.750
Is it a black Escalade?
It's tied to a double homicide.

4053
02:09:55.790 --> 02:09:57.280
-Is the guy trying to kill himself?
-I don't think he was involved.

4054
02:09:57.320 --> 02:09:58.610
No, you're not going
anywhere near the place.

4055
02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:07.130
Help! Help!

4056
02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:08.020
-Take it easy.
-Please help me!

4057
02:10:08.060 --> 02:10:09.180
-Help me! Get me out!
-Calm down.

4058
02:10:10.980 --> 02:10:11.720
-Help me!
-The windshield is wired in.

4059
02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:12.710
The side windows are
connected to the electrical system.

4060
02:10:12.750 --> 02:10:14.140
The glass seems OK,
but there are wires everywhere.

4061
02:10:16.110 --> 02:10:16.780
We've got his contact details.

4062
02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:22.070
-What's going on?
-My mobile!

4063
02:10:22.110 --> 02:10:23.310
-Yes?
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

4064
02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:24.720
I need to know whether you were
on the bridge last night.

4065
02:10:25.010 --> 02:10:25.820
-What?
-Were you on the Öresund Bridge?

4066
02:10:25.860 --> 02:10:26.930
I was working.
I was here all the time.

4067
02:10:27.300 --> 02:10:28.300
-How will you get me out?
-I don't know, that's not my job.

4068
02:10:28.340 --> 02:10:29.410
-Do you know Kerstin Ekwall?
-Who?

4069
02:10:29.450 --> 02:10:30.340
Daniel? Did you do anything
apart from turn the key?

4070
02:10:30.380 --> 02:10:31.720
No. Everything locked.
The countdown started.

4071
02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:32.550
-Hello?
-I'm talking to the bomb guy.

4072
02:10:32.590 --> 02:10:33.360
Chairman of the City Council
Kerstin Ekwall.

4073
02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:34.850
-Have you written about her?
-No, I don't know.

4074
02:10:34.890 --> 02:10:35.970
-Have you been tipped off about her?
-No! What is this?

4075
02:10:36.010 --> 02:10:36.670
Get me out! Please!

4076
02:10:36.710 --> 02:10:37.830
Does anyone else
have a key to your car?

4077
02:10:37.870 --> 02:10:39.270
-No, I don't know.
-Can you reach it?

4078
02:10:39.310 --> 02:10:40.190
I don't want to die. Please.

4079
02:10:40.230 --> 02:10:41.510
-I don't want it to end like this.
-Daniel? You need to talk to me.

4080
02:10:42.700 --> 02:10:44.090
It skipped a minute.
What the hell did you do?

4081
02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:45.880
It was three, now it's two.
It was three.

4082
02:10:46.370 --> 02:10:47.300
Come one, hurry up.

4083
02:10:47.340 --> 02:10:48.600
Where are you going?
Stay here! Please!

4084
02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:50.790
Please! Come back!
Where are you going?

4085
02:10:54.060 --> 02:10:55.440
You need to talk to me.
Daniel? Daniel?

4086
02:10:55.850 --> 02:10:56.410
Is it a big bomb?

4087
02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:58.510
-I think so.
-You're not religious, right?

4088
02:10:58.550 --> 02:10:59.220
You're an atheist?

4089
02:10:59.260 --> 02:11:00.780
Everything will just stop. The body
won't have time to register pain.

4090
02:11:01.890 --> 02:11:03.310
-Are you sure?
-Don't look at the clock. Listen.

4091
02:11:03.350 --> 02:11:04.750
Do you know why your car
was used to dump two bodies?

4092
02:11:05.430 --> 02:11:06.240
-No.
-Think about it. Focus.

4093
02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:07.660
-Who did this to you?
-I've slagged so many people off.

4094
02:11:10.820 --> 02:11:11.880
Daniel? Are you still there? Hello?

4095
02:11:18.730 --> 02:11:19.250
It's clean.

4096
02:11:21.150 --> 02:11:22.310
Sorry about the drama, it's hard
to make oneself heard today.

4097
02:11:22.350 --> 02:11:23.130
I assume I have your attention now.

4098
02:11:23.170 --> 02:11:24.770
Our part of the world would be
wonderful if we solved our problems.

4099
02:11:24.810 --> 02:11:25.640
I would like to
point out five in particular.

4100
02:11:25.680 --> 02:11:27.300
This is only a beginning. We've got
interesting times ahead of us.

4101
02:11:27.300 --> 02:11:28.200
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-Copenhagen Police.

4102
02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:28.930
-Do you know who she is?
-Yes.

4103
02:11:29.210 --> 02:11:30.890
Excuse me. A woman insists on
speaking to the person in charge.

4104
02:11:31.340 --> 02:11:32.430
-Is she in Sweden or Denmark?
-I don't know.

4105
02:11:32.700 --> 02:11:34.100
She's Swedish, and the car came
from Sweden. I assume I'm in charge.

4106
02:11:35.490 --> 02:11:36.630
-Saga Norén. Can I help you?
-When will you let traffic through?

4107
02:11:36.670 --> 02:11:37.730
-It might take up to two hours.
-I haven't got two hours!

4108
02:11:37.770 --> 02:11:38.530
-Back up.
-Is someone's life in danger?

4109
02:11:38.570 --> 02:11:39.340
There's a heart for my husband
in Copenhagen.

4110
02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:40.460
He needs a heart transplant.
Let us through.

4111
02:11:40.500 --> 02:11:41.450
He'll have to wait.
I can't let anyone through.

4112
02:11:41.820 --> 02:11:42.940
-What's happened?
-Is there no other way through?

4113
02:11:42.980 --> 02:11:43.980
There ought to be
another way through.

4114
02:11:44.020 --> 02:11:45.470
-No one's answering any questions.
-Let me pass, please.

4115
02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:49.310
The Öresund Bridge to Denmark
is closed.

4116
02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:50.230
According to the police it will...

4117
02:11:54.910 --> 02:11:56.150
-It's Stefan Lindberg.
-Hi, it's Veronika.

4118
02:11:56.190 --> 02:11:57.570
-Sorry, did I wake you up?
-No, you didn't. How are you?

4119
02:11:57.610 --> 02:11:58.800
I can't sleep.
I've got a stomach ache.

4120
02:11:58.840 --> 02:11:59.900
-I see. How are the boys?
-They're asleep.

4121
02:11:59.940 --> 02:12:00.980
They don't understand
what's about to happen.

4122
02:12:01.020 --> 02:12:02.300
-Can we meet up?
-Now?

4123
02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:03.770
Of course.
Do you want me to come over?

4124
02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:05.610
-No. I'd rather go to your place.
-OK.

4125
02:12:05.650 --> 02:12:06.590
-I can go to the office.
-I'll see you there.

4126
02:12:09.210 --> 02:12:10.240
Give me everything from
when the car came on to the bridge.

4127
02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:11.510
One camera records at a time.
They're started manually.

4128
02:12:11.550 --> 02:12:12.410
My colleague
might have recorded something.

4129
02:12:12.450 --> 02:12:13.480
Hello! Stop! Stop!

4130
02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:14.860
-Stop! Stop!
-I allowed it.

4131
02:12:14.900 --> 02:12:16.170
-Why? This is a crime scene.
-I'm fully aware of that.

4132
02:12:16.210 --> 02:12:16.960
-We've got enough bodies.
-He wasn't dying.

4133
02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:18.020
-Are you a doctor?
-No, I'm a police officer.

4134
02:12:18.610 --> 02:12:19.780
-What's your name?
-Martin Rohde.

4135
02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:20.720
-Rohde?
-R, O, H, D, E.

4136
02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:22.440
-Have you got an ID?
-It was an ambulance.

4137
02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:23.670
The Chairman
of Malmö City Council is dead.

4138
02:12:23.710 --> 02:12:25.010
-What evidence was destroyed?
-Probably none.

4139
02:12:25.050 --> 02:12:25.560
Thank you.

4140
02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:32.850
Hello. Hi. Finally.

4141
02:12:32.890 --> 02:12:34.300
I wont operate on Göran, Charlotte.
I had wine with my dinner.

4142
02:12:34.620 --> 02:12:36.190
-At what time? Are you drunk?
-No, but that doesn't matter.

4143
02:12:36.530 --> 02:12:37.510
You promised to see us through this.

4144
02:12:37.550 --> 02:12:38.630
-Morten Krag is a very good surgeon.
-Better than you?

4145
02:12:38.670 --> 02:12:39.540
I'll decide
who my husband's surgeon is!

4146
02:12:39.580 --> 02:12:41.050
-I wont forgive you if it goes wrong.
-What if I do it and it goes wrong?

4147
02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:42.610
Then I'll never forgive myself.

4148
02:12:46.510 --> 02:12:47.720
-We're done, you can move her.
-You can take her away.

4149
02:12:49.810 --> 02:12:50.340
Bloody hell.

4150
02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:55.830
The autopsy on Kerstin Ekwall
is being performed.

4151
02:12:55.870 --> 02:12:56.790
-And the recordings?
-They'll deliver them tomorrow.

4152
02:12:56.830 --> 02:12:57.590
-What about the press?
-They know.

4153
02:12:57.630 --> 02:12:58.690
The radio said that it was a woman.
They don't know who it is.

4154
02:12:58.730 --> 02:13:00.010
-And the family?
-I'm on my way to see them.

4155
02:13:00.050 --> 02:13:01.540
You'll wake them up, and there
are children there. Tread lightly.

4156
02:13:01.580 --> 02:13:03.130
In what sense? Oh. There aren't
that many ways to say it.

4157
02:13:03.170 --> 02:13:03.930
-Just tread lightly.
-Listen, Hans...

4158
02:13:03.970 --> 02:13:04.670
She was chopped in half.

4159
02:13:04.710 --> 02:13:05.780
-Right above the hips.
-What the hell are you saying?

4160
02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:07.860
She was due to attend a conference
in Copenhagen this morning.

4161
02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:09.220
-Have you got more computers?
-No.

4162
02:13:09.260 --> 02:13:10.150
Are you taking them?
The children's as well?

4163
02:13:10.190 --> 02:13:11.330
-When did you last talk to her?
-She called yesterday.

4164
02:13:11.550 --> 02:13:12.380
-Do you know what time it was?
-I don't know.

4165
02:13:12.610 --> 02:13:13.450
Around half past six in the evening.

4166
02:13:13.490 --> 02:13:14.290
-Was she threatened?
-By whom?

4167
02:13:14.330 --> 02:13:15.100
I didn't say that she was,
I asked you.

4168
02:13:15.380 --> 02:13:17.040
Not really. She was a politician,
there were some calls and emails.

4169
02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:18.530
-Has she upset anyone lately?
-Lately...

4170
02:13:18.770 --> 02:13:19.770
She wanted to charge for
library loans. Some disapproved.

4171
02:13:20.020 --> 02:13:20.790
-That's foolish.
-Sorry, what?

4172
02:13:20.830 --> 02:13:22.430
Reading becomes a money matter.
Social differences will grow.

4173
02:13:22.470 --> 02:13:23.390
-Is that why she was...?
-We don't know why.

4174
02:13:23.430 --> 02:13:24.170
It's unlikely
that library fees caused it.

4175
02:13:24.540 --> 02:13:25.420
Why? Why did someone do this?

4176
02:13:25.460 --> 02:13:27.110
Can you think of something personal?
Was she in debt? Did she use drugs?

4177
02:13:27.150 --> 02:13:27.880
Did she have an affair?

4178
02:13:31.700 --> 02:13:32.290
Saga Norén.

4179
02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:33.360
Can't we talk on the phone?

4180
02:13:33.900 --> 02:13:34.830
I'll be there in twenty minutes. Bye.

4181
02:13:46.250 --> 02:13:46.750
August?

4182
02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:00.590
-Were you on the bridge?
-Yes.

4183
02:14:00.630 --> 02:14:01.650
-What happened?
-A murder, the Swedes will handle it.

4184
02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:02.500
-Did you check on August?
-Yes.

4185
02:14:02.540 --> 02:14:03.420
-Is he asleep?
-Yes.

4186
02:14:03.460 --> 02:14:04.530
You promised to talk to him.
He's become a night owl.

4187
02:14:04.570 --> 02:14:05.340
Do you want me to
wake him up now?

4188
02:14:05.630 --> 02:14:06.970
-He got up at three o'clock today.
-I'll have a word with him tomorrow.

4189
02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:11.090
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

4190
02:14:16.860 --> 02:14:18.330
-Do you know the cause of death?
-I can make a qualified guess.

4191
02:14:18.370 --> 02:14:19.310
She died six to eight hours ago.

4192
02:14:19.350 --> 02:14:20.600
Yes, she called home at six thirty
and was dumped just after midnight.

4193
02:14:21.010 --> 02:14:21.820
There's something else.

4194
02:14:21.860 --> 02:14:22.500
-What?
-Take a look.

4195
02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:31.280
No livor mortis on the ears.
That's consistent with the bleeding.

4196
02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:32.030
Petechiae on the conjunctivas.

4197
02:14:32.810 --> 02:14:33.410
The face is swollen.

4198
02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:35.490
She was strangled
and cut in half after death.

4199
02:14:35.730 --> 02:14:36.290
And the other half?

4200
02:14:37.720 --> 02:14:38.910
The lower body is much paler.
A lot paler.

4201
02:14:39.570 --> 02:14:40.770
It's not coherent with the bleeding
or how the body was placed.

4202
02:14:41.890 --> 02:14:42.990
There's brown discoloration.
Frostbite?

4203
02:14:43.260 --> 02:14:44.410
It feels different. Frostbite.

4204
02:14:44.450 --> 02:14:45.170
Not frostbite, deep-freezing.

4205
02:14:45.210 --> 02:14:46.400
For about a year, I think.
I've never seen anything like this.

4206
02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:47.690
I don't know who they belong to.
They're not Kerstin Ekwall's legs.

4207
02:14:53.390 --> 02:14:54.270
-So everyone's here, then.
-Yes.

4208
02:14:54.310 --> 02:14:54.810
Hi, Sebastian.

4209
02:14:56.050 --> 02:14:56.630
I don't know what to do.

4210
02:14:56.670 --> 02:14:57.710
I'm worried about tomorrow.
I had to see you.

4211
02:14:57.750 --> 02:14:58.520
Can't you just pay the rent?

4212
02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:00.000
They can't evict the children.
Can they? Their friends are there.

4213
02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:00.840
I paid out money for the rent.

4214
02:15:01.420 --> 02:15:02.390
-Why did you bring the children?
-Sören wasn't there.

4215
02:15:02.810 --> 02:15:03.400
I can't manage.

4216
02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:04.810
-Can't you make an exception?
-No. You know I can't.

4217
02:15:04.850 --> 02:15:05.820
-Please.
-There are guidelines. I'm sorry.

4218
02:15:09.990 --> 02:15:11.270
Charlotte Söringer? I'm Frederik
Henriksen, hospital administrator.

4219
02:15:11.850 --> 02:15:13.150
-Göran had atrial fibrillation.
-They managed to stop it.

4220
02:15:13.190 --> 02:15:14.230
-He's to weak for surgery.
-Too weak?

4221
02:15:14.270 --> 02:15:15.450
-But there's a new heart.
-It will be given to someone else.

4222
02:15:15.820 --> 02:15:16.790
Anders said
that you need a new CT scanner.

4223
02:15:16.830 --> 02:15:18.410
My husband's business is doing well.
He's willing to donate a CT scanner.

4224
02:15:18.450 --> 02:15:19.220
We're cancelling for his own sake.

4225
02:15:19.260 --> 02:15:20.580
He'll die without a new heart.
I want both parties to benefit.

4226
02:15:20.620 --> 02:15:22.260
Pass my offer on
to the proper authority, please.

4227
02:15:27.900 --> 02:15:28.600
-Hello? Is this Martin Rohde?
-Yes.

4228
02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:29.770
-It's Saga Norén from the bridge.
-Yes, I remember.

4229
02:15:29.810 --> 02:15:31.460
-Were you asleep?
-I tend to doze off around this time.

4230
02:15:31.500 --> 02:15:32.350
-There were two women.
-You found another one.

4231
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:33.320
The lower body
belonged to someone else.

4232
02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:34.620
-Have you found half a body?
-I don't know.

4233
02:15:34.660 --> 02:15:36.150
It could be more than a year ago.
The legs have been deep-frozen.

4234
02:15:36.190 --> 02:15:37.350
-Can you look into it? Now?
-First thing tomorrow morning.

4235
02:15:37.620 --> 02:15:38.570
Can someone else
look into it straight away?

4236
02:15:39.370 --> 02:15:40.300
-I'll call you back.
-When?

4237
02:15:42.190 --> 02:15:42.830
-Do you have to get up?
-Yes.

4238
02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:50.830
Missing woman, Caucasian,
at least a year ago...

4239
02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:51.530
-How old?
-Adult.

4240
02:15:51.780 --> 02:15:52.570
-And life in general is OK?
-Yes.

4241
02:15:52.610 --> 02:15:53.290
-What about you?
-I'm fine.

4242
02:15:53.770 --> 02:15:55.110
-So you'll be firing blanks.
-Was it in the staff news bulletin?

4243
02:15:55.150 --> 02:15:56.550
-Is everything working as it should?
-It will in time.

4244
02:15:56.590 --> 02:15:57.230
It can't be much fun.

4245
02:15:57.270 --> 02:15:58.460
-What do you mean?
-You've heard about castrated toms?

4246
02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:00.160
A wild predator turns into
a chunky sleepyhead. Just like that.

4247
02:16:00.750 --> 02:16:02.050
They're castrated,
that's not the same thing.

4248
02:16:02.530 --> 02:16:03.220
Let's see what we've got.

4249
02:16:03.900 --> 02:16:04.520
Two women killed a year apart.

4250
02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:05.770
One was deep-frozen.
They were dismembered.

4251
02:16:05.810 --> 02:16:07.430
And assembled on the bridge.
Someone wants to make a statement.

4252
02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:10.200
-Saga Norén.
-It's Martin.

4253
02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:11.700
The lower body is Monique Brammer,
I think. A missing 23-year-old.

4254
02:16:11.740 --> 02:16:12.510
-Can you email the info?
-I'll be right over.

4255
02:16:12.550 --> 02:16:13.530
-Why do you want to come here?
-She's Danish.

4256
02:16:13.570 --> 02:16:14.740
I was first on the scene.
Everyone's still asleep here.

4257
02:16:14.780 --> 02:16:15.610
-Do you mind if I come over?
-Yes.

4258
02:16:15.650 --> 02:16:16.770
Make sure I'm allowed in.
You've got my details.

4259
02:16:17.170 --> 02:16:18.650
Martin Rohde has probably identified
the second body. He's coming over.

4260
02:16:18.690 --> 02:16:19.820
-Is that a problem?
-Yes...

4261
02:16:20.170 --> 02:16:20.690
No, no.

4262
02:16:20.730 --> 02:16:22.180
If half of the body is Danish,
we have to cooperate.

4263
02:16:22.220 --> 02:16:22.950
I'll schedule a meeting
at half past five.

4264
02:16:22.990 --> 02:16:23.950
-Can you be ready by then?
-Yes.

4265
02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:31.530
It finally worked out.

4266
02:16:33.450 --> 02:16:35.020
-What did you just sign?
-Formalities.

4267
02:16:35.620 --> 02:16:36.680
-Whose is it?
-What?

4268
02:16:36.720 --> 02:16:37.310
The heart. Whose is it?

4269
02:16:37.350 --> 02:16:38.400
A man's. He's 25 or 26
and had a motorcycle accident.

4270
02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:40.620
-What's his name?
-I don't know. Does it matter?

4271
02:16:41.310 --> 02:16:42.290
No, I guess it doesn't.

4272
02:16:43.250 --> 02:16:44.600
-I'm scared.
-It will be fine.

4273
02:16:45.020 --> 02:16:46.380
Anders will operate, they're all
highly skilled. It will be fine.

4274
02:16:46.660 --> 02:16:47.310
I can't imagine life without you.

4275
02:16:48.130 --> 02:16:49.810
-I need to take Göran with me.
-Don't worry. You'll make it, honey.

4276
02:16:50.960 --> 02:16:51.570
-Hi.
-Hi.

4277
02:16:51.610 --> 02:16:52.410
-Hi! An early breakfast?
-No thank you.

4278
02:16:52.450 --> 02:16:53.820
-An email would have been faster.
-Yes, but not as pleasant.

4279
02:16:54.490 --> 02:16:55.580
-Where are you going?
-I'm coming in with you.

4280
02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:57.810
If it really is Monique Brammer,
we both have responsibilities.

4281
02:16:58.610 --> 02:16:59.530
Go straight on,
turn left, and register.

4282
02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:03.780
-Good morning. Coffee?
-No thanks, I've already had some.

4283
02:17:03.820 --> 02:17:05.150
I'm Martin Rohde.
I'll be working with Saga.

4284
02:17:05.190 --> 02:17:06.720
-Thank you. You need to register.
-I also need a card.

4285
02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:07.510
-My name's Felicia.
-Nice to meet you.

4286
02:17:07.970 --> 02:17:08.870
-That's it. This is for you.
-Thank you.

4287
02:17:08.910 --> 02:17:10.170
-And one of these is for you.
-Thanks! Ooh, Danish.

4288
02:17:11.190 --> 02:17:11.830
-See you later.
-I hope so.

4289
02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:15.690
-Where's Saga Norén?
-To the right. Bye!

4290
02:17:18.950 --> 02:17:19.570
Excuse me.

4291
02:17:19.610 --> 02:17:20.420
-Sit down.
-I'm afraid I can't.

4292
02:17:21.650 --> 02:17:22.940
-You make me nervous.
-OK, I can stand still.

4293
02:17:22.980 --> 02:17:24.260
-Why can't you sit down?
-My nether regions hurt.

4294
02:17:24.710 --> 02:17:26.060
-I had a vasectomy yesterday.
-Right.

4295
02:17:26.100 --> 02:17:26.930
I've got five children
with three different women.

4296
02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:28.280
-Have you got children?
-No, why would I want to?

4297
02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:29.390
-I've never heard anyone ask that.
-Many should have.

4298
02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:31.570
Not you,
I'm sure you're a wonderful dad.

4299
02:17:33.950 --> 02:17:35.250
-Why aren't you off sick?
-I can't afford it. August moved in.

4300
02:17:35.290 --> 02:17:37.040
Well, it's not really about money.
It was a small procedure, I can work.

4301
02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:37.940
-You can't sit down.
-I can.

4302
02:17:37.980 --> 02:17:39.050
-I drove here.
-Pretend that the chair is a car.

4303
02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:41.300
Yes.

4304
02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:44.910
-No one wanted to solve the case.
-What do you mean?

4305
02:17:44.950 --> 02:17:45.790
Monique Brammer
was reported missing.

4306
02:17:45.830 --> 02:17:47.320
Two prostitutes and a neighbour were
interviewed. The case was shelved.

4307
02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:48.220
It fell between two stools.

4308
02:17:48.260 --> 02:17:49.500
She disappeared, or she was killed.
They didn't find a body.

4309
02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:50.650
The case was
supposed to be shelved.

4310
02:17:50.690 --> 02:17:51.870
I'm surprised it took two weeks.
Come with me.

4311
02:17:55.170 --> 02:17:56.270
Do you think I should?
I tried painkillers, but...

4312
02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:57.840
-Two computers?
-They know who it is now.

4313
02:17:57.880 --> 02:17:58.640
-Will Saga handle the case, Hans?
-Yes.

4314
02:17:58.680 --> 02:17:59.570
-That's good.
-And a Danish police officer.

4315
02:17:59.610 --> 02:18:01.360
-Does he know that she's a bit odd?
-If not, he'll soon find out.

4316
02:18:02.780 --> 02:18:03.720
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

4317
02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:04.970
-This is Martin Röhde.
-It's Rohde.

4318
02:18:05.010 --> 02:18:06.270
Not as when you say "fur".
Rohde, Foure...

4319
02:18:07.140 --> 02:18:08.260
-Have you read the file?
-Most people have just arrived.

4320
02:18:08.300 --> 02:18:09.330
Half of two female bodies were found.
One was Kerstin Ekwall.

4321
02:18:09.370 --> 02:18:10.110
The other one has been deep-frozen.
Martin?

4322
02:18:10.150 --> 02:18:11.470
It's probably the 23-year-old
Monique Brammer from Copenhagen.

4323
02:18:11.510 --> 02:18:12.690
A prostitute and an addict
that went missing 13 months ago.

4324
02:18:13.340 --> 02:18:14.330
Do you want me to repeat that?
A bit slower?

4325
02:18:14.520 --> 02:18:15.480
Monique Brammer, 23 years old.
A prostitute and an addict.

4326
02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:16.380
She went missing 13 months ago.

4327
02:18:16.420 --> 02:18:17.950
-Right.
-The investigation was inadequate.

4328
02:18:18.770 --> 02:18:20.270
-Don't you agree?
-Yes. It was terrible.

4329
02:18:20.310 --> 02:18:21.380
But we found blood traces
in her apartment.

4330
02:18:21.420 --> 02:18:22.770
The samples are on their way
and can be compared to the body.

4331
02:18:22.810 --> 02:18:24.000
Before the bodies were dumped,
the power was cut for 48 seconds.

4332
02:18:24.040 --> 02:18:25.020
Their trying to trace the signal.
Can you help them, Gry?

4333
02:18:25.060 --> 02:18:26.040
-How was it done?
-Someone accessed a computer.

4334
02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:26.520
Can you show me the fourth picture?

4335
02:18:26.950 --> 02:18:27.560
Use all the people you need. Gry?

4336
02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:28.940
Here's Ekwall's mobile number.
Get the phone records.

4337
02:18:28.980 --> 02:18:30.080
Check her computers.
Talk to John about passwords.

4338
02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:30.990
Anne?
Find out where she was abducted.

4339
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:32.220
She left work half past six.
She had a car. Find it!

4340
02:18:32.260 --> 02:18:33.660
-Were they dumped from her car?
-No, a black Cadillac Escalade.

4341
02:18:33.700 --> 02:18:35.120
The image where the bridge
is seen from above.

4342
02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:36.480
-John can find the license number.
-What? Sure.

4343
02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:37.470
-What are you doing?
-I had an idea.

4344
02:18:37.510 --> 02:18:39.000
The orange line the body was on...
We discussed where she was.

4345
02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:39.850
Here's the Swedish-Danish border.

4346
02:18:39.890 --> 02:18:40.950
One half is in Sweden,
one is in Denmark.

4347
02:18:40.990 --> 02:18:42.060
-It's millimetre perfect.
-Tell me everything about the line.

4348
02:18:42.100 --> 02:18:42.690
Take paint samples.

4349
02:18:42.730 --> 02:18:44.260
Power cut, body halves, a politician.
We'll be in the public eye.

4350
02:18:52.780 --> 02:18:54.270
-Hi. Is Veronika at home?
-Yes.

4351
02:18:54.310 --> 02:18:55.160
-What do you want?
-I would like to talk to her.

4352
02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:56.400
-You can talk to me.
-I would if you were clean.

4353
02:18:56.870 --> 02:18:57.580
-What? I am clean.
-Hi, Veronika.

4354
02:18:57.620 --> 02:18:59.060
-Isn't it enough to have us evicted?
-The landlord did that.

4355
02:18:59.490 --> 02:19:00.970
-You're not helping.
-I'm trying. I'm trying really hard.

4356
02:19:01.010 --> 02:19:02.470
If you had been more dependable,
you wouldn't have to move.

4357
02:19:03.450 --> 02:19:04.900
-That was bloody stupid.
-Sören! Stop it!

4358
02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:07.500
What the hell?

4359
02:19:09.050 --> 02:19:09.780
Stop, you bastard!

4360
02:19:11.700 --> 02:19:12.290
Stop! Come out!

4361
02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.950
Sören! Stop it, Sören! Stop it!

4362
02:19:15.990 --> 02:19:16.870
-I hate that bloody bastard!
-Sören!

4363
02:19:17.310 --> 02:19:18.610
He's caused trouble all along.
It makes me so angry!

4364
02:19:18.650 --> 02:19:20.120
Let go of me.
Go to hell, you bloody idiots.

4365
02:19:29.870 --> 02:19:30.680
-How's the operation going?
-It hasn't started.

4366
02:19:30.720 --> 02:19:31.810
-Why? He was prepared hours ago.
-I don't know.

4367
02:19:31.850 --> 02:19:32.540
I'm afraid I have to go.

4368
02:19:32.580 --> 02:19:34.070
-Don't you know where he is?
-You probably know better than me.

4369
02:19:34.110 --> 02:19:35.510
We'll call you if we hear from him...
Let's go.

4370
02:19:36.020 --> 02:19:37.240
-I'm sorry about all of this.
-Stop apologizing for him.

4371
02:19:37.970 --> 02:19:39.140
He's an adult
and makes his own decisions.

4372
02:19:39.180 --> 02:19:40.770
Maybe you should do the same?
Sören put you in this position.

4373
02:19:41.050 --> 02:19:42.350
You spend your money wisely,
but can't if you're not given any.

4374
02:19:42.840 --> 02:19:43.760
You don't get the chance
to care for your boys.

4375
02:19:44.280 --> 02:19:45.330
-He hits you and the children.
-Hardly ever the children.

4376
02:19:45.370 --> 02:19:46.360
Hardly ever? That's not good enough.

4377
02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:47.450
He shouldn't hit any of you.

4378
02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:49.400
You can get your life back on track.
Just you and the children.

4379
02:19:50.570 --> 02:19:51.440
Leave your husband
or nothing will change.

4380
02:19:52.210 --> 02:19:52.770
Think about it.

4381
02:19:55.800 --> 02:19:57.460
-Anders? What's going on?
-We've got a problem.

4382
02:19:57.500 --> 02:19:58.930
The donor was declared brain dead,
and a nurse spoke to his father.

4383
02:19:58.970 --> 02:20:00.290
The father changed his mind.
We can't have the heart. Göran!

4384
02:20:06.560 --> 02:20:07.190
Wasn't that the turn-off?

4385
02:20:07.760 --> 02:20:08.900
-Stefan? Wasn't that the turn-off?
-No, not today.

4386
02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:10.550
-Where are we going?
-You'll see.

4387
02:20:17.820 --> 02:20:19.420
Johan was nicknamed "The old bag".
He died a month ago.

4388
02:20:19.690 --> 02:20:21.290
No wife, no children, no debts,
no assets. The house was all he had.

4389
02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:22.300
It went to the local council.

4390
02:20:25.050 --> 02:20:25.550
It's Sören.

4391
02:20:26.980 --> 02:20:27.480
Come.

4392
02:20:35.530 --> 02:20:36.660
-Step inside.
-What about the children?

4393
02:20:36.700 --> 02:20:37.380
They can stay outside a while longer.

4394
02:20:38.820 --> 02:20:40.270
-Where are we? Why are we here?
-Just go inside.

4395
02:20:43.180 --> 02:20:44.630
-Crime scene and meeting place.
-Have you worked here a long time?

4396
02:20:44.670 --> 02:20:45.220
-More than ten years?
-Yes.

4397
02:20:45.260 --> 02:20:46.340
-Are you from around here?
-From Malmö? No.

4398
02:20:46.380 --> 02:20:48.100
I'm from Copenhagen.
I was born there.

4399
02:20:48.690 --> 02:20:50.580
No wonder Ingmar Bergman
and Lars Norén are from Sweden.

4400
02:20:50.790 --> 02:20:51.850
-Are you related to Lars Norén?
-No.

4401
02:20:52.190 --> 02:20:53.090
We need to find the meeting place
and the crime scene.

4402
02:20:53.130 --> 02:20:54.310
Where did the perpetrator
meet the victim?

4403
02:20:57.740 --> 02:20:58.970
I've spoken to Copenhagen.
You'll cooperate on the deaths.

4404
02:20:59.180 --> 02:21:00.010
Here's info about your authority.

4405
02:21:00.050 --> 02:21:01.210
I know what applies to me
in Denmark.

4406
02:21:01.850 --> 02:21:02.600
-Can I have a word with you, Saga?
-Yes.

4407
02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.990
The report you filed
against Martin...

4408
02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:05.660
Yes, there's only one.

4409
02:21:05.700 --> 02:21:06.670
What do you suggest I do with it?

4410
02:21:06.710 --> 02:21:07.670
Don't you think
it will affect your cooperation?

4411
02:21:07.950 --> 02:21:08.780
-Do you think so?
-I think there's every chance.

4412
02:21:08.970 --> 02:21:10.080
-Will he dislike me?
-That might happen.

4413
02:21:10.120 --> 02:21:11.640
Because of my report?
It doesn't have to affect the case.

4414
02:21:11.680 --> 02:21:12.680
He let an ambulance through.
No life was in danger.

4415
02:21:12.720 --> 02:21:13.690
-I'm supposed to file a report.
-I'll handle the report.

4416
02:21:13.730 --> 02:21:15.350
-Yes, that's fine. Fine.
-I've got the car's license number.

4417
02:21:15.390 --> 02:21:16.200
It belongs to Daniel Farbé in Malmö.

4418
02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:17.110
-The journalist?
-Yes, he's a journalist.

4419
02:21:19.060 --> 02:21:20.340
-Do you know who he is?
-Yes. I read his column.

4420
02:21:21.070 --> 02:21:21.630
It's entertaining.

4421
02:21:35.130 --> 02:21:36.530
-You made me jump.
-I worked all night.

4422
02:21:36.570 --> 02:21:37.760
-I'm done for the week. Berlin next.
-You work all night.

4423
02:21:37.800 --> 02:21:38.660
Then you get down in Berlin.
How do you manage?

4424
02:21:38.700 --> 02:21:39.830
Get down?
How many children have you got?

4425
02:21:39.870 --> 02:21:40.750
Children that suck the life
out of you.

4426
02:21:40.790 --> 02:21:42.440
I haven't got children. No one says
"get down" any more. No one.

4427
02:21:43.080 --> 02:21:43.730
-Have fun.
-I will.

4428
02:21:43.770 --> 02:21:44.440
I downloaded
"Elephants in the Desert".

4429
02:21:44.920 --> 02:21:45.510
What do you want, Åke?

4430
02:21:45.550 --> 02:21:46.610
A hug, an award, an applause?
Would you like one?

4431
02:21:47.200 --> 02:21:48.350
-They're really cool. I like them.
-Yes, they were cool.

4432
02:21:48.390 --> 02:21:49.780
What?
Two weeks ago you really liked them.

4433
02:21:49.820 --> 02:21:50.370
And now you like them.

4434
02:21:50.910 --> 02:21:51.440
My daughter...

4435
02:21:52.590 --> 02:21:53.560
-She danced all afternoon.
-Sorry, I have to answer.

4436
02:21:54.100 --> 02:21:54.940
We'll have to continue this later.

4437
02:21:56.810 --> 02:21:57.660
You and the boys will disappear.

4438
02:21:57.700 --> 02:21:58.560
Your paperwork
and your debts are gone.

4439
02:21:59.140 --> 02:22:00.300
You can make a fresh start.
Do you understand?

4440
02:22:00.740 --> 02:22:02.490
You can make a fresh start.
There's cash and a mobile here.

4441
02:22:02.980 --> 02:22:04.170
But you can never see or talk to
your husband again.

4442
02:22:04.710 --> 02:22:05.770
He's their dad.
I have to let them see him.

4443
02:22:05.810 --> 02:22:06.850
Why? Why do they have to?

4444
02:22:07.520 --> 02:22:09.090
To get another beating?
To be scared and broke?

4445
02:22:09.130 --> 02:22:10.650
Let him spend everything on drugs?
He'll ruin everything for you again.

4446
02:22:11.010 --> 02:22:11.710
People like him ruin things.

4447
02:22:12.450 --> 02:22:13.380
You don't know me.
Why are you doing this?

4448
02:22:15.770 --> 02:22:16.440
Because I can.

4449
02:22:27.900 --> 02:22:28.400
Bloody hell.

4450
02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:37.470
-Here's my car.
-Do you think it's him?

4451
02:22:37.510 --> 02:22:38.730
He kept a body in a freezer
and killed a politician.

4452
02:22:38.770 --> 02:22:39.820
-He wouldn't use his own car.
-Nice car.

4453
02:22:39.860 --> 02:22:41.120
-Is the Swedish police paid well?
-No, the same as in Denmark.

4454
02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:42.550
Don't jump to conclusions
about my wages based on my car.

4455
02:22:42.590 --> 02:22:43.840
Maybe it was a gift?
Maybe I inherited it or had savings?

4456
02:22:43.880 --> 02:22:45.110
I hope your professional conclusions
are more valid.

4457
02:22:45.150 --> 02:22:46.400
Read this.
It's Daniel Ferbé's latest column.

4458
02:22:46.440 --> 02:22:47.690
-The one that's a good writer?
-No, I said he's entertaining.

4459
02:22:47.730 --> 02:22:48.360
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

4460
02:23:00.930 --> 02:23:02.090
Hello? What's going on?

4461
02:23:02.130 --> 02:23:03.440
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-A Cadillac has a bomb in it.

4462
02:23:03.480 --> 02:23:04.480
Is it a black Escalade?
It's tied to a double homicide.

4463
02:23:04.520 --> 02:23:06.010
-Is the guy trying to kill himself?
-I don't think he was involved.

4464
02:23:06.050 --> 02:23:07.340
No, you're not going
anywhere near the place.

4465
02:23:14.850 --> 02:23:15.860
Help! Help!

4466
02:23:16.050 --> 02:23:16.750
-Take it easy.
-Please help me!

4467
02:23:16.790 --> 02:23:17.910
-Help me! Get me out!
-Calm down.

4468
02:23:19.710 --> 02:23:20.450
-Help me!
-The windshield is wired in.

4469
02:23:20.490 --> 02:23:21.440
The side windows are
connected to the electrical system.

4470
02:23:21.480 --> 02:23:22.870
The glass seems OK,
but there are wires everywhere.

4471
02:23:24.840 --> 02:23:25.510
We've got his contact details.

4472
02:23:29.850 --> 02:23:30.800
-What's going on?
-My mobile!

4473
02:23:30.840 --> 02:23:32.040
-Yes?
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

4474
02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:33.450
I need to know whether you were
on the bridge last night.

4475
02:23:33.740 --> 02:23:34.550
-What?
-Were you on the Öresund Bridge?

4476
02:23:34.590 --> 02:23:35.660
I was working.
I was here all the time.

4477
02:23:36.030 --> 02:23:37.030
-How will you get me out?
-I don't know, that's not my job.

4478
02:23:37.070 --> 02:23:38.140
-Do you know Kerstin Ekwall?
-Who?

4479
02:23:38.180 --> 02:23:39.070
Daniel? Did you do anything
apart from turn the key?

4480
02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:40.450
No. Everything locked.
The countdown started.

4481
02:23:40.490 --> 02:23:41.280
-Hello?
-I'm talking to the bomb guy.

4482
02:23:41.320 --> 02:23:42.090
Chairman of the City Council
Kerstin Ekwall.

4483
02:23:42.130 --> 02:23:43.580
-Have you written about her?
-No, I don't know.

4484
02:23:43.620 --> 02:23:44.700
-Have you been tipped off about her?
-No! What is this?

4485
02:23:44.740 --> 02:23:45.400
Get me out! Please!

4486
02:23:45.440 --> 02:23:46.560
Does anyone else
have a key to your car?

4487
02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:48.000
-No, I don't know.
-Can you reach it?

4488
02:23:48.040 --> 02:23:48.920
I don't want to die. Please.

4489
02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:50.240
-I don't want it to end like this.
-Daniel? You need to talk to me.

4490
02:23:51.430 --> 02:23:52.820
It skipped a minute.
What the hell did you do?

4491
02:23:53.030 --> 02:23:54.610
It was three, now it's two.
It was three.

4492
02:23:55.100 --> 02:23:56.030
Come one, hurry up.

4493
02:23:56.070 --> 02:23:57.330
Where are you going?
Stay here! Please!

4494
02:23:57.930 --> 02:23:59.520
Please! Come back!
Where are you going?

4495
02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:04.170
You need to talk to me.
Daniel? Daniel?

4496
02:24:04.580 --> 02:24:05.140
Is it a big bomb?

4497
02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:07.240
-I think so.
-You're not religious, right?

4498
02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:07.950
You're an atheist?

4499
02:24:07.990 --> 02:24:09.510
Everything will just stop. The body
won't have time to register pain.

4500
02:24:10.620 --> 02:24:12.040
-Are you sure?
-Don't look at the clock. Listen.

4501
02:24:12.080 --> 02:24:13.480
Do you know why your car
was used to dump two bodies?

4502
02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:14.970
-No.
-Think about it. Focus.

4503
02:24:15.010 --> 02:24:16.390
-Who did this to you?
-I've slagged so many people off.

4504
02:24:19.550 --> 02:24:20.610
Daniel? Are you still there? Hello?

4505
02:24:27.460 --> 02:24:27.980
It's clean.

4506
02:24:29.880 --> 02:24:31.040
Sorry about the drama, it's hard
to make oneself heard today.

4507
02:24:31.080 --> 02:24:31.860
I assume I have your attention now.

4508
02:24:31.900 --> 02:24:33.500
Our part of the world would be
wonderful if we solved our problems.

4509
02:24:33.540 --> 02:24:34.370
I would like to
point out five in particular.

4510
02:24:34.410 --> 02:24:36.030
This is only a beginning. We've got
interesting times ahead of us.

4511
02:24:36.030 --> 02:24:36.930
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-Copenhagen Police.

4512
02:24:36.970 --> 02:24:37.660
-Do you know who she is?
-Yes.

4513
02:24:37.940 --> 02:24:39.620
Excuse me. A woman insists on
speaking to the person in charge.

4514
02:24:40.070 --> 02:24:41.160
-Is she in Sweden or Denmark?
-I don't know.

4515
02:24:41.430 --> 02:24:42.830
She's Swedish, and the car came
from Sweden. I assume I'm in charge.

4516
02:24:44.220 --> 02:24:45.360
-Saga Norén. Can I help you?
-When will you let traffic through?

4517
02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:46.460
-It might take up to two hours.
-I haven't got two hours!

4518
02:24:46.500 --> 02:24:47.260
-Back up.
-Is someone's life in danger?

4519
02:24:47.300 --> 02:24:48.070
There's a heart for my husband
in Copenhagen.

4520
02:24:48.110 --> 02:24:49.190
He needs a heart transplant.
Let us through.

4521
02:24:49.230 --> 02:24:50.180
He'll have to wait.
I can't let anyone through.

4522
02:24:50.550 --> 02:24:51.670
-What's happened?
-Is there no other way through?

4523
02:24:51.710 --> 02:24:52.710
There ought to be
another way through.

4524
02:24:52.750 --> 02:24:54.200
-No one's answering any questions.
-Let me pass, please.

4525
02:24:56.730 --> 02:24:58.040
The Öresund Bridge to Denmark
is closed.

4526
02:24:58.080 --> 02:24:58.960
According to the police it will...

4527
02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:04.880
-It's Stefan Lindberg.
-Hi, it's Veronika.

4528
02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:06.300
-Sorry, did I wake you up?
-No, you didn't. How are you?

4529
02:25:06.340 --> 02:25:07.530
I can't sleep.
I've got a stomach ache.

4530
02:25:07.570 --> 02:25:08.630
-I see. How are the boys?
-They're asleep.

4531
02:25:08.670 --> 02:25:09.710
They don't understand
what's about to happen.

4532
02:25:09.750 --> 02:25:11.030
-Can we meet up?
-Now?

4533
02:25:11.650 --> 02:25:12.500
Of course.
Do you want me to come over?

4534
02:25:12.930 --> 02:25:14.340
-No. I'd rather go to your place.
-OK.

4535
02:25:14.380 --> 02:25:15.320
-I can go to the office.
-I'll see you there.

4536
02:25:17.940 --> 02:25:18.970
Give me everything from
when the car came on to the bridge.

4537
02:25:19.010 --> 02:25:20.240
One camera records at a time.
They're started manually.

4538
02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:21.140
My colleague
might have recorded something.

4539
02:25:21.180 --> 02:25:22.210
Hello! Stop! Stop!

4540
02:25:22.250 --> 02:25:23.590
-Stop! Stop!
-I allowed it.

4541
02:25:23.630 --> 02:25:24.900
-Why? This is a crime scene.
-I'm fully aware of that.

4542
02:25:24.940 --> 02:25:25.690
-We've got enough bodies.
-He wasn't dying.

4543
02:25:25.730 --> 02:25:26.750
-Are you a doctor?
-No, I'm a police officer.

4544
02:25:27.340 --> 02:25:28.510
-What's your name?
-Martin Rohde.

4545
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:29.450
-Rohde?
-R, O, H, D, E.

4546
02:25:29.490 --> 02:25:31.170
-Have you got an ID?
-It was an ambulance.

4547
02:25:31.210 --> 02:25:32.400
The Chairman
of Malmö City Council is dead.

4548
02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:33.740
-What evidence was destroyed?
-Probably none.

4549
02:25:33.780 --> 02:25:34.290
Thank you.

4550
02:25:40.730 --> 02:25:41.580
Hello. Hi. Finally.

4551
02:25:41.620 --> 02:25:43.030
I wont operate on Göran, Charlotte.
I had wine with my dinner.

4552
02:25:43.350 --> 02:25:44.920
-At what time? Are you drunk?
-No, but that doesn't matter.

4553
02:25:45.260 --> 02:25:46.240
You promised to see us through this.

4554
02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:47.360
-Morten Krag is a very good surgeon.
-Better than you?

4555
02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:48.270
I'll decide
who my husband's surgeon is!

4556
02:25:48.310 --> 02:25:49.780
-I wont forgive you if it goes wrong.
-What if I do it and it goes wrong?

4557
02:25:50.450 --> 02:25:51.340
Then I'll never forgive myself.

4558
02:25:55.240 --> 02:25:56.450
-We're done, you can move her.
-You can take her away.

4559
02:25:58.540 --> 02:25:59.070
Bloody hell.

4560
02:26:03.410 --> 02:26:04.560
The autopsy on Kerstin Ekwall
is being performed.

4561
02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:05.520
-And the recordings?
-They'll deliver them tomorrow.

4562
02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:06.320
-What about the press?
-They know.

4563
02:26:06.360 --> 02:26:07.420
The radio said that it was a woman.
They don't know who it is.

4564
02:26:07.460 --> 02:26:08.740
-And the family?
-I'm on my way to see them.

4565
02:26:08.780 --> 02:26:10.270
You'll wake them up, and there
are children there. Tread lightly.

4566
02:26:10.310 --> 02:26:11.860
In what sense? Oh. There aren't
that many ways to say it.

4567
02:26:11.900 --> 02:26:12.660
-Just tread lightly.
-Listen, Hans...

4568
02:26:12.700 --> 02:26:13.400
She was chopped in half.

4569
02:26:13.440 --> 02:26:14.510
-Right above the hips.
-What the hell are you saying?

4570
02:26:15.130 --> 02:26:16.590
She was due to attend a conference
in Copenhagen this morning.

4571
02:26:16.890 --> 02:26:17.950
-Have you got more computers?
-No.

4572
02:26:17.990 --> 02:26:18.880
Are you taking them?
The children's as well?

4573
02:26:18.920 --> 02:26:20.060
-When did you last talk to her?
-She called yesterday.

4574
02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:21.110
-Do you know what time it was?
-I don't know.

4575
02:26:21.340 --> 02:26:22.180
Around half past six in the evening.

4576
02:26:22.220 --> 02:26:23.020
-Was she threatened?
-By whom?

4577
02:26:23.060 --> 02:26:23.830
I didn't say that she was,
I asked you.

4578
02:26:24.110 --> 02:26:25.770
Not really. She was a politician,
there were some calls and emails.

4579
02:26:25.810 --> 02:26:27.260
-Has she upset anyone lately?
-Lately...

4580
02:26:27.500 --> 02:26:28.500
She wanted to charge for
library loans. Some disapproved.

4581
02:26:28.750 --> 02:26:29.520
-That's foolish.
-Sorry, what?

4582
02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:31.160
Reading becomes a money matter.
Social differences will grow.

4583
02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:32.120
-Is that why she was...?
-We don't know why.

4584
02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:32.900
It's unlikely
that library fees caused it.

4585
02:26:33.270 --> 02:26:34.150
Why? Why did someone do this?

4586
02:26:34.190 --> 02:26:35.840
Can you think of something personal?
Was she in debt? Did she use drugs?

4587
02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:36.610
Did she have an affair?

4588
02:26:40.430 --> 02:26:41.020
Saga Norén.

4589
02:26:41.490 --> 02:26:42.090
Can't we talk on the phone?

4590
02:26:42.630 --> 02:26:43.560
I'll be there in twenty minutes. Bye.

4591
02:26:54.980 --> 02:26:55.480
August?

4592
02:27:08.530 --> 02:27:09.320
-Were you on the bridge?
-Yes.

4593
02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:10.380
-What happened?
-A murder, the Swedes will handle it.

4594
02:27:10.650 --> 02:27:11.230
-Did you check on August?
-Yes.

4595
02:27:11.270 --> 02:27:12.150
-Is he asleep?
-Yes.

4596
02:27:12.190 --> 02:27:13.260
You promised to talk to him.
He's become a night owl.

4597
02:27:13.300 --> 02:27:14.070
Do you want me to
wake him up now?

4598
02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:15.700
-He got up at three o'clock today.
-I'll have a word with him tomorrow.

4599
02:27:18.690 --> 02:27:19.820
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

4600
02:27:25.590 --> 02:27:27.060
-Do you know the cause of death?
-I can make a qualified guess.

4601
02:27:27.100 --> 02:27:28.040
She died six to eight hours ago.

4602
02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:29.330
Yes, she called home at six thirty
and was dumped just after midnight.

4603
02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:30.550
There's something else.

4604
02:27:30.590 --> 02:27:31.230
-What?
-Take a look.

4605
02:27:38.410 --> 02:27:40.010
No livor mortis on the ears.
That's consistent with the bleeding.

4606
02:27:40.050 --> 02:27:40.760
Petechiae on the conjunctivas.

4607
02:27:41.540 --> 02:27:42.140
The face is swollen.

4608
02:27:43.230 --> 02:27:44.220
She was strangled
and cut in half after death.

4609
02:27:44.460 --> 02:27:45.020
And the other half?

4610
02:27:46.450 --> 02:27:47.640
The lower body is much paler.
A lot paler.

4611
02:27:48.300 --> 02:27:49.500
It's not coherent with the bleeding
or how the body was placed.

4612
02:27:50.620 --> 02:27:51.720
There's brown discoloration.
Frostbite?

4613
02:27:51.990 --> 02:27:53.140
It feels different. Frostbite.

4614
02:27:53.180 --> 02:27:53.900
Not frostbite, deep-freezing.

4615
02:27:53.940 --> 02:27:55.130
For about a year, I think.
I've never seen anything like this.

4616
02:27:55.170 --> 02:27:56.420
I don't know who they belong to.
They're not Kerstin Ekwall's legs.

4617
02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:03.000
-So everyone's here, then.
-Yes.

4618
02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:03.540
Hi, Sebastian.

4619
02:28:04.780 --> 02:28:05.360
I don't know what to do.

4620
02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:06.440
I'm worried about tomorrow.
I had to see you.

4621
02:28:06.480 --> 02:28:07.250
Can't you just pay the rent?

4622
02:28:07.290 --> 02:28:08.730
They can't evict the children.
Can they? Their friends are there.

4623
02:28:08.770 --> 02:28:09.570
I paid out money for the rent.

4624
02:28:10.150 --> 02:28:11.120
-Why did you bring the children?
-Sören wasn't there.

4625
02:28:11.540 --> 02:28:12.130
I can't manage.

4626
02:28:12.330 --> 02:28:13.540
-Can't you make an exception?
-No. You know I can't.

4627
02:28:13.580 --> 02:28:14.550
-Please.
-There are guidelines. I'm sorry.

4628
02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:20.000
Charlotte Söringer? I'm Frederik
Henriksen, hospital administrator.

4629
02:28:20.580 --> 02:28:21.880
-Göran had atrial fibrillation.
-They managed to stop it.

4630
02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:22.960
-He's to weak for surgery.
-Too weak?

4631
02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:24.180
-But there's a new heart.
-It will be given to someone else.

4632
02:28:24.550 --> 02:28:25.520
Anders said
that you need a new CT scanner.

4633
02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:27.140
My husband's business is doing well.
He's willing to donate a CT scanner.

4634
02:28:27.180 --> 02:28:27.950
We're cancelling for his own sake.

4635
02:28:27.990 --> 02:28:29.310
He'll die without a new heart.
I want both parties to benefit.

4636
02:28:29.350 --> 02:28:30.990
Pass my offer on
to the proper authority, please.

4637
02:28:36.630 --> 02:28:37.330
-Hello? Is this Martin Rohde?
-Yes.

4638
02:28:37.370 --> 02:28:38.500
-It's Saga Norén from the bridge.
-Yes, I remember.

4639
02:28:38.540 --> 02:28:40.190
-Were you asleep?
-I tend to doze off around this time.

4640
02:28:40.230 --> 02:28:41.080
-There were two women.
-You found another one.

4641
02:28:41.120 --> 02:28:42.050
The lower body
belonged to someone else.

4642
02:28:42.090 --> 02:28:43.350
-Have you found half a body?
-I don't know.

4643
02:28:43.390 --> 02:28:44.880
It could be more than a year ago.
The legs have been deep-frozen.

4644
02:28:44.920 --> 02:28:46.080
-Can you look into it? Now?
-First thing tomorrow morning.

4645
02:28:46.350 --> 02:28:47.300
Can someone else
look into it straight away?

4646
02:28:48.100 --> 02:28:49.030
-I'll call you back.
-When?

4647
02:28:50.920 --> 02:28:51.560
-Do you have to get up?
-Yes.

4648
02:28:58.490 --> 02:28:59.560
Missing woman, Caucasian,
at least a year ago...

4649
02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:00.260
-How old?
-Adult.

4650
02:29:00.510 --> 02:29:01.300
-And life in general is OK?
-Yes.

4651
02:29:01.340 --> 02:29:02.020
-What about you?
-I'm fine.

4652
02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:03.840
-So you'll be firing blanks.
-Was it in the staff news bulletin?

4653
02:29:03.880 --> 02:29:05.280
-Is everything working as it should?
-It will in time.

4654
02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:05.960
It can't be much fun.

4655
02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:07.190
-What do you mean?
-You've heard about castrated toms?

4656
02:29:07.490 --> 02:29:08.890
A wild predator turns into
a chunky sleepyhead. Just like that.

4657
02:29:09.480 --> 02:29:10.780
They're castrated,
that's not the same thing.

4658
02:29:11.260 --> 02:29:11.950
Let's see what we've got.

4659
02:29:12.630 --> 02:29:13.250
Two women killed a year apart.

4660
02:29:13.290 --> 02:29:14.500
One was deep-frozen.
They were dismembered.

4661
02:29:14.540 --> 02:29:16.160
And assembled on the bridge.
Someone wants to make a statement.

4662
02:29:18.290 --> 02:29:18.930
-Saga Norén.
-It's Martin.

4663
02:29:18.970 --> 02:29:20.430
The lower body is Monique Brammer,
I think. A missing 23-year-old.

4664
02:29:20.470 --> 02:29:21.240
-Can you email the info?
-I'll be right over.

4665
02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:22.260
-Why do you want to come here?
-She's Danish.

4666
02:29:22.300 --> 02:29:23.470
I was first on the scene.
Everyone's still asleep here.

4667
02:29:23.510 --> 02:29:24.340
-Do you mind if I come over?
-Yes.

4668
02:29:24.380 --> 02:29:25.500
Make sure I'm allowed in.
You've got my details.

4669
02:29:25.900 --> 02:29:27.380
Martin Rohde has probably identified
the second body. He's coming over.

4670
02:29:27.420 --> 02:29:28.550
-Is that a problem?
-Yes...

4671
02:29:28.900 --> 02:29:29.420
No, no.

4672
02:29:29.460 --> 02:29:30.910
If half of the body is Danish,
we have to cooperate.

4673
02:29:30.950 --> 02:29:31.680
I'll schedule a meeting
at half past five.

4674
02:29:31.720 --> 02:29:32.680
-Can you be ready by then?
-Yes.

4675
02:29:39.690 --> 02:29:40.260
It finally worked out.

4676
02:29:42.180 --> 02:29:43.750
-What did you just sign?
-Formalities.

4677
02:29:44.350 --> 02:29:45.410
-Whose is it?
-What?

4678
02:29:45.450 --> 02:29:46.040
The heart. Whose is it?

4679
02:29:46.080 --> 02:29:47.130
A man's. He's 25 or 26
and had a motorcycle accident.

4680
02:29:48.010 --> 02:29:49.350
-What's his name?
-I don't know. Does it matter?

4681
02:29:50.040 --> 02:29:51.020
No, I guess it doesn't.

4682
02:29:51.980 --> 02:29:53.330
-I'm scared.
-It will be fine.

4683
02:29:53.750 --> 02:29:55.110
Anders will operate, they're all
highly skilled. It will be fine.

4684
02:29:55.390 --> 02:29:56.040
I can't imagine life without you.

4685
02:29:56.860 --> 02:29:58.540
-I need to take Göran with me.
-Don't worry. You'll make it, honey.

4686
02:29:59.690 --> 02:30:00.300
-Hi.
-Hi.

4687
02:30:00.340 --> 02:30:01.140
-Hi! An early breakfast?
-No thank you.

4688
02:30:01.180 --> 02:30:02.550
-An email would have been faster.
-Yes, but not as pleasant.

4689
02:30:03.220 --> 02:30:04.310
-Where are you going?
-I'm coming in with you.

4690
02:30:04.730 --> 02:30:06.540
If it really is Monique Brammer,
we both have responsibilities.

4691
02:30:07.340 --> 02:30:08.260
Go straight on,
turn left, and register.

4692
02:30:10.930 --> 02:30:12.510
-Good morning. Coffee?
-No thanks, I've already had some.

4693
02:30:12.550 --> 02:30:13.880
I'm Martin Rohde.
I'll be working with Saga.

4694
02:30:13.920 --> 02:30:15.450
-Thank you. You need to register.
-I also need a card.

4695
02:30:15.490 --> 02:30:16.240
-My name's Felicia.
-Nice to meet you.

4696
02:30:16.700 --> 02:30:17.600
-That's it. This is for you.
-Thank you.

4697
02:30:17.640 --> 02:30:18.900
-And one of these is for you.
-Thanks! Ooh, Danish.

4698
02:30:19.920 --> 02:30:20.560
-See you later.
-I hope so.

4699
02:30:22.930 --> 02:30:24.420
-Where's Saga Norén?
-To the right. Bye!

4700
02:30:27.680 --> 02:30:28.300
Excuse me.

4701
02:30:28.340 --> 02:30:29.150
-Sit down.
-I'm afraid I can't.

4702
02:30:30.380 --> 02:30:31.670
-You make me nervous.
-OK, I can stand still.

4703
02:30:31.710 --> 02:30:32.990
-Why can't you sit down?
-My nether regions hurt.

4704
02:30:33.440 --> 02:30:34.790
-I had a vasectomy yesterday.
-Right.

4705
02:30:34.830 --> 02:30:35.660
I've got five children
with three different women.

4706
02:30:36.010 --> 02:30:37.010
-Have you got children?
-No, why would I want to?

4707
02:30:37.050 --> 02:30:38.120
-I've never heard anyone ask that.
-Many should have.

4708
02:30:39.290 --> 02:30:40.300
Not you,
I'm sure you're a wonderful dad.

4709
02:30:42.680 --> 02:30:43.980
-Why aren't you off sick?
-I can't afford it. August moved in.

4710
02:30:44.020 --> 02:30:45.770
Well, it's not really about money.
It was a small procedure, I can work.

4711
02:30:45.810 --> 02:30:46.670
-You can't sit down.
-I can.

4712
02:30:46.710 --> 02:30:47.780
-I drove here.
-Pretend that the chair is a car.

4713
02:30:49.530 --> 02:30:50.030
Yes.

4714
02:30:52.570 --> 02:30:53.640
-No one wanted to solve the case.
-What do you mean?

4715
02:30:53.680 --> 02:30:54.520
Monique Brammer
was reported missing.

4716
02:30:54.560 --> 02:30:56.050
Two prostitutes and a neighbour were
interviewed. The case was shelved.

4717
02:30:56.290 --> 02:30:56.950
It fell between two stools.

4718
02:30:56.990 --> 02:30:58.230
She disappeared, or she was killed.
They didn't find a body.

4719
02:30:58.650 --> 02:30:59.380
The case was
supposed to be shelved.

4720
02:30:59.420 --> 02:31:00.600
I'm surprised it took two weeks.
Come with me.

4721
02:31:03.900 --> 02:31:05.000
Do you think I should?
I tried painkillers, but...

4722
02:31:05.760 --> 02:31:06.570
-Two computers?
-They know who it is now.

4723
02:31:06.610 --> 02:31:07.370
-Will Saga handle the case, Hans?
-Yes.

4724
02:31:07.410 --> 02:31:08.300
-That's good.
-And a Danish police officer.

4725
02:31:08.340 --> 02:31:10.090
-Does he know that she's a bit odd?
-If not, he'll soon find out.

4726
02:31:11.510 --> 02:31:12.450
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

4727
02:31:12.490 --> 02:31:13.700
-This is Martin Röhde.
-It's Rohde.

4728
02:31:13.740 --> 02:31:15.000
Not as when you say "fur".
Rohde, Foure...

4729
02:31:15.870 --> 02:31:16.990
-Have you read the file?
-Most people have just arrived.

4730
02:31:17.030 --> 02:31:18.060
Half of two female bodies were found.
One was Kerstin Ekwall.

4731
02:31:18.100 --> 02:31:18.840
The other one has been deep-frozen.
Martin?

4732
02:31:18.880 --> 02:31:20.200
It's probably the 23-year-old
Monique Brammer from Copenhagen.

4733
02:31:20.240 --> 02:31:21.420
A prostitute and an addict
that went missing 13 months ago.

4734
02:31:22.070 --> 02:31:23.060
Do you want me to repeat that?
A bit slower?

4735
02:31:23.250 --> 02:31:24.210
Monique Brammer, 23 years old.
A prostitute and an addict.

4736
02:31:24.250 --> 02:31:25.110
She went missing 13 months ago.

4737
02:31:25.150 --> 02:31:26.680
-Right.
-The investigation was inadequate.

4738
02:31:27.500 --> 02:31:29.000
-Don't you agree?
-Yes. It was terrible.

4739
02:31:29.040 --> 02:31:30.110
But we found blood traces
in her apartment.

4740
02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:31.500
The samples are on their way
and can be compared to the body.

4741
02:31:31.540 --> 02:31:32.730
Before the bodies were dumped,
the power was cut for 48 seconds.

4742
02:31:32.770 --> 02:31:33.750
Their trying to trace the signal.
Can you help them, Gry?

4743
02:31:33.790 --> 02:31:34.770
-How was it done?
-Someone accessed a computer.

4744
02:31:34.810 --> 02:31:35.250
Can you show me the fourth picture?

4745
02:31:35.680 --> 02:31:36.290
Use all the people you need. Gry?

4746
02:31:36.330 --> 02:31:37.670
Here's Ekwall's mobile number.
Get the phone records.

4747
02:31:37.710 --> 02:31:38.810
Check her computers.
Talk to John about passwords.

4748
02:31:38.850 --> 02:31:39.720
Anne?
Find out where she was abducted.

4749
02:31:39.760 --> 02:31:40.950
She left work half past six.
She had a car. Find it!

4750
02:31:40.990 --> 02:31:42.390
-Were they dumped from her car?
-No, a black Cadillac Escalade.

4751
02:31:42.430 --> 02:31:43.850
The image where the bridge
is seen from above.

4752
02:31:43.890 --> 02:31:45.210
-John can find the license number.
-What? Sure.

4753
02:31:45.250 --> 02:31:46.200
-What are you doing?
-I had an idea.

4754
02:31:46.240 --> 02:31:47.730
The orange line the body was on...
We discussed where she was.

4755
02:31:47.770 --> 02:31:48.580
Here's the Swedish-Danish border.

4756
02:31:48.620 --> 02:31:49.680
One half is in Sweden,
one is in Denmark.

4757
02:31:49.720 --> 02:31:50.790
-It's millimetre perfect.
-Tell me everything about the line.

4758
02:31:50.830 --> 02:31:51.420
Take paint samples.

4759
02:31:51.460 --> 02:31:52.990
Power cut, body halves, a politician.
We'll be in the public eye.

4760
02:32:01.510 --> 02:32:03.000
-Hi. Is Veronika at home?
-Yes.

4761
02:32:03.040 --> 02:32:03.890
-What do you want?
-I would like to talk to her.

4762
02:32:03.930 --> 02:32:05.130
-You can talk to me.
-I would if you were clean.

4763
02:32:05.600 --> 02:32:06.310
-What? I am clean.
-Hi, Veronika.

4764
02:32:06.350 --> 02:32:07.790
-Isn't it enough to have us evicted?
-The landlord did that.

4765
02:32:08.220 --> 02:32:09.700
-You're not helping.
-I'm trying. I'm trying really hard.

4766
02:32:09.740 --> 02:32:11.200
If you had been more dependable,
you wouldn't have to move.

4767
02:32:12.180 --> 02:32:13.630
-That was bloody stupid.
-Sören! Stop it!

4768
02:32:15.730 --> 02:32:16.230
What the hell?

4769
02:32:17.780 --> 02:32:18.510
Stop, you bastard!

4770
02:32:20.430 --> 02:32:21.020
Stop! Come out!

4771
02:32:23.840 --> 02:32:24.680
Sören! Stop it, Sören! Stop it!

4772
02:32:24.720 --> 02:32:25.600
-I hate that bloody bastard!
-Sören!

4773
02:32:26.040 --> 02:32:27.340
He's caused trouble all along.
It makes me so angry!

4774
02:32:27.380 --> 02:32:28.850
Let go of me.
Go to hell, you bloody idiots.

4775
02:32:38.600 --> 02:32:39.410
-How's the operation going?
-It hasn't started.

4776
02:32:39.450 --> 02:32:40.540
-Why? He was prepared hours ago.
-I don't know.

4777
02:32:40.580 --> 02:32:41.270
I'm afraid I have to go.

4778
02:32:41.310 --> 02:32:42.800
-Don't you know where he is?
-You probably know better than me.

4779
02:32:42.840 --> 02:32:44.240
We'll call you if we hear from him...
Let's go.

4780
02:32:44.750 --> 02:32:45.970
-I'm sorry about all of this.
-Stop apologizing for him.

4781
02:32:46.700 --> 02:32:47.870
He's an adult
and makes his own decisions.

4782
02:32:47.910 --> 02:32:49.500
Maybe you should do the same?
Sören put you in this position.

4783
02:32:49.780 --> 02:32:51.080
You spend your money wisely,
but can't if you're not given any.

4784
02:32:51.570 --> 02:32:52.490
You don't get the chance
to care for your boys.

4785
02:32:53.010 --> 02:32:54.060
-He hits you and the children.
-Hardly ever the children.

4786
02:32:54.100 --> 02:32:55.090
Hardly ever? That's not good enough.

4787
02:32:55.450 --> 02:32:56.180
He shouldn't hit any of you.

4788
02:32:56.490 --> 02:32:58.130
You can get your life back on track.
Just you and the children.

4789
02:32:59.300 --> 02:33:00.170
Leave your husband
or nothing will change.

4790
02:33:00.940 --> 02:33:01.500
Think about it.

4791
02:33:04.530 --> 02:33:06.190
-Anders? What's going on?
-We've got a problem.

4792
02:33:06.230 --> 02:33:07.660
The donor was declared brain dead,
and a nurse spoke to his father.

4793
02:33:07.700 --> 02:33:09.020
The father changed his mind.
We can't have the heart. Göran!

4794
02:33:15.290 --> 02:33:15.920
Wasn't that the turn-off?

4795
02:33:16.490 --> 02:33:17.630
-Stefan? Wasn't that the turn-off?
-No, not today.

4796
02:33:18.250 --> 02:33:19.280
-Where are we going?
-You'll see.

4797
02:33:26.550 --> 02:33:28.150
Johan was nicknamed "The old bag".
He died a month ago.

4798
02:33:28.420 --> 02:33:30.020
No wife, no children, no debts,
no assets. The house was all he had.

4799
02:33:30.320 --> 02:33:31.030
It went to the local council.

4800
02:33:33.780 --> 02:33:34.280
It's Sören.

4801
02:33:35.710 --> 02:33:36.210
Come.

4802
02:33:44.260 --> 02:33:45.390
-Step inside.
-What about the children?

4803
02:33:45.430 --> 02:33:46.110
They can stay outside a while longer.

4804
02:33:47.550 --> 02:33:49.000
-Where are we? Why are we here?
-Just go inside.

4805
02:33:51.910 --> 02:33:53.360
-Crime scene and meeting place.
-Have you worked here a long time?

4806
02:33:53.400 --> 02:33:53.950
-More than ten years?
-Yes.

4807
02:33:53.990 --> 02:33:55.070
-Are you from around here?
-From Malmö? No.

4808
02:33:55.110 --> 02:33:56.830
I'm from Copenhagen.
I was born there.

4809
02:33:57.420 --> 02:33:59.310
No wonder Ingmar Bergman
and Lars Norén are from Sweden.

4810
02:33:59.520 --> 02:34:00.580
-Are you related to Lars Norén?
-No.

4811
02:34:00.920 --> 02:34:01.820
We need to find the meeting place
and the crime scene.

4812
02:34:01.860 --> 02:34:03.040
Where did the perpetrator
meet the victim?

4813
02:34:06.470 --> 02:34:07.700
I've spoken to Copenhagen.
You'll cooperate on the deaths.

4814
02:34:07.910 --> 02:34:08.740
Here's info about your authority.

4815
02:34:08.780 --> 02:34:09.940
I know what applies to me
in Denmark.

4816
02:34:10.580 --> 02:34:11.330
-Can I have a word with you, Saga?
-Yes.

4817
02:34:12.800 --> 02:34:13.720
The report you filed
against Martin...

4818
02:34:13.760 --> 02:34:14.390
Yes, there's only one.

4819
02:34:14.430 --> 02:34:15.400
What do you suggest I do with it?

4820
02:34:15.440 --> 02:34:16.400
Don't you think
it will affect your cooperation?

4821
02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:17.510
-Do you think so?
-I think there's every chance.

4822
02:34:17.700 --> 02:34:18.810
-Will he dislike me?
-That might happen.

4823
02:34:18.850 --> 02:34:20.370
Because of my report?
It doesn't have to affect the case.

4824
02:34:20.410 --> 02:34:21.410
He let an ambulance through.
No life was in danger.

4825
02:34:21.450 --> 02:34:22.420
-I'm supposed to file a report.
-I'll handle the report.

4826
02:34:22.460 --> 02:34:24.080
-Yes, that's fine. Fine.
-I've got the car's license number.

4827
02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:24.930
It belongs to Daniel Farbé in Malmö.

4828
02:34:24.970 --> 02:34:25.840
-The journalist?
-Yes, he's a journalist.

4829
02:34:27.790 --> 02:34:29.070
-Do you know who he is?
-Yes. I read his column.

4830
02:34:29.800 --> 02:34:30.360
It's entertaining.

4831
02:34:43.860 --> 02:34:45.260
-You made me jump.
-I worked all night.

4832
02:34:45.300 --> 02:34:46.490
-I'm done for the week. Berlin next.
-You work all night.

4833
02:34:46.530 --> 02:34:47.390
Then you get down in Berlin.
How do you manage?

4834
02:34:47.430 --> 02:34:48.560
Get down?
How many children have you got?

4835
02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:49.480
Children that suck the life
out of you.

4836
02:34:49.520 --> 02:34:51.170
I haven't got children. No one says
"get down" any more. No one.

4837
02:34:51.810 --> 02:34:52.460
-Have fun.
-I will.

4838
02:34:52.500 --> 02:34:53.170
I downloaded
"Elephants in the Desert".

4839
02:34:53.650 --> 02:34:54.240
What do you want, Åke?

4840
02:34:54.280 --> 02:34:55.340
A hug, an award, an applause?
Would you like one?

4841
02:34:55.930 --> 02:34:57.080
-They're really cool. I like them.
-Yes, they were cool.

4842
02:34:57.120 --> 02:34:58.510
What?
Two weeks ago you really liked them.

4843
02:34:58.550 --> 02:34:59.100
And now you like them.

4844
02:34:59.640 --> 02:35:00.170
My daughter...

4845
02:35:01.320 --> 02:35:02.290
-She danced all afternoon.
-Sorry, I have to answer.

4846
02:35:02.830 --> 02:35:03.670
We'll have to continue this later.

4847
02:35:05.540 --> 02:35:06.390
You and the boys will disappear.

4848
02:35:06.430 --> 02:35:07.290
Your paperwork
and your debts are gone.

4849
02:35:07.870 --> 02:35:09.030
You can make a fresh start.
Do you understand?

4850
02:35:09.470 --> 02:35:11.220
You can make a fresh start.
There's cash and a mobile here.

4851
02:35:11.710 --> 02:35:12.900
But you can never see or talk to
your husband again.

4852
02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:14.500
He's their dad.
I have to let them see him.

4853
02:35:14.540 --> 02:35:15.580
Why? Why do they have to?

4854
02:35:16.250 --> 02:35:17.820
To get another beating?
To be scared and broke?

4855
02:35:17.860 --> 02:35:19.380
Let him spend everything on drugs?
He'll ruin everything for you again.

4856
02:35:19.740 --> 02:35:20.440
People like him ruin things.

4857
02:35:21.180 --> 02:35:22.110
You don't know me.
Why are you doing this?

4858
02:35:24.500 --> 02:35:25.170
Because I can.

4859
02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:37.130
Bloody hell.

4860
02:35:45.330 --> 02:35:46.200
-Here's my car.
-Do you think it's him?

4861
02:35:46.240 --> 02:35:47.460
He kept a body in a freezer
and killed a politician.

4862
02:35:47.500 --> 02:35:48.550
-He wouldn't use his own car.
-Nice car.

4863
02:35:48.590 --> 02:35:49.850
-Is the Swedish police paid well?
-No, the same as in Denmark.

4864
02:35:49.890 --> 02:35:51.280
Don't jump to conclusions
about my wages based on my car.

4865
02:35:51.320 --> 02:35:52.570
Maybe it was a gift?
Maybe I inherited it or had savings?

4866
02:35:52.610 --> 02:35:53.840
I hope your professional conclusions
are more valid.

4867
02:35:53.880 --> 02:35:55.130
Read this.
It's Daniel Ferbé's latest column.

4868
02:35:55.170 --> 02:35:56.420
-The one that's a good writer?
-No, I said he's entertaining.

4869
02:35:56.460 --> 02:35:57.090
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

4870
02:36:09.660 --> 02:36:10.820
Hello? What's going on?

4871
02:36:10.860 --> 02:36:12.170
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-A Cadillac has a bomb in it.

4872
02:36:12.210 --> 02:36:13.210
Is it a black Escalade?
It's tied to a double homicide.

4873
02:36:13.250 --> 02:36:14.740
-Is the guy trying to kill himself?
-I don't think he was involved.

4874
02:36:14.780 --> 02:36:16.070
No, you're not going
anywhere near the place.

4875
02:36:23.580 --> 02:36:24.590
Help! Help!

4876
02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:25.480
-Take it easy.
-Please help me!

4877
02:36:25.520 --> 02:36:26.640
-Help me! Get me out!
-Calm down.

4878
02:36:28.440 --> 02:36:29.180
-Help me!
-The windshield is wired in.

4879
02:36:29.220 --> 02:36:30.170
The side windows are
connected to the electrical system.

4880
02:36:30.210 --> 02:36:31.600
The glass seems OK,
but there are wires everywhere.

4881
02:36:33.570 --> 02:36:34.240
We've got his contact details.

4882
02:36:38.580 --> 02:36:39.530
-What's going on?
-My mobile!

4883
02:36:39.570 --> 02:36:40.770
-Yes?
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

4884
02:36:40.810 --> 02:36:42.180
I need to know whether you were
on the bridge last night.

4885
02:36:42.470 --> 02:36:43.280
-What?
-Were you on the Öresund Bridge?

4886
02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:44.390
I was working.
I was here all the time.

4887
02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:45.760
-How will you get me out?
-I don't know, that's not my job.

4888
02:36:45.800 --> 02:36:46.870
-Do you know Kerstin Ekwall?
-Who?

4889
02:36:46.910 --> 02:36:47.800
Daniel? Did you do anything
apart from turn the key?

4890
02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:49.180
No. Everything locked.
The countdown started.

4891
02:36:49.220 --> 02:36:50.010
-Hello?
-I'm talking to the bomb guy.

4892
02:36:50.050 --> 02:36:50.820
Chairman of the City Council
Kerstin Ekwall.

4893
02:36:50.860 --> 02:36:52.310
-Have you written about her?
-No, I don't know.

4894
02:36:52.350 --> 02:36:53.430
-Have you been tipped off about her?
-No! What is this?

4895
02:36:53.470 --> 02:36:54.130
Get me out! Please!

4896
02:36:54.170 --> 02:36:55.290
Does anyone else
have a key to your car?

4897
02:36:55.330 --> 02:36:56.730
-No, I don't know.
-Can you reach it?

4898
02:36:56.770 --> 02:36:57.650
I don't want to die. Please.

4899
02:36:57.690 --> 02:36:58.970
-I don't want it to end like this.
-Daniel? You need to talk to me.

4900
02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:01.550
It skipped a minute.
What the hell did you do?

4901
02:37:01.760 --> 02:37:03.340
It was three, now it's two.
It was three.

4902
02:37:03.830 --> 02:37:04.760
Come one, hurry up.

4903
02:37:04.800 --> 02:37:06.060
Where are you going?
Stay here! Please!

4904
02:37:06.660 --> 02:37:08.250
Please! Come back!
Where are you going?

4905
02:37:11.520 --> 02:37:12.900
You need to talk to me.
Daniel? Daniel?

4906
02:37:13.310 --> 02:37:13.870
Is it a big bomb?

4907
02:37:14.810 --> 02:37:15.970
-I think so.
-You're not religious, right?

4908
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:16.680
You're an atheist?

4909
02:37:16.720 --> 02:37:18.240
Everything will just stop. The body
won't have time to register pain.

4910
02:37:19.350 --> 02:37:20.770
-Are you sure?
-Don't look at the clock. Listen.

4911
02:37:20.810 --> 02:37:22.210
Do you know why your car
was used to dump two bodies?

4912
02:37:22.890 --> 02:37:23.700
-No.
-Think about it. Focus.

4913
02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:25.120
-Who did this to you?
-I've slagged so many people off.

4914
02:37:28.280 --> 02:37:29.340
Daniel? Are you still there? Hello?

4915
02:37:36.190 --> 02:37:36.710
It's clean.

4916
02:37:38.610 --> 02:37:39.770
Sorry about the drama, it's hard
to make oneself heard today.

4917
02:37:39.810 --> 02:37:40.590
I assume I have your attention now.

4918
02:37:40.630 --> 02:37:42.230
Our part of the world would be
wonderful if we solved our problems.

4919
02:37:42.270 --> 02:37:43.100
I would like to
point out five in particular.

4920
02:37:43.140 --> 02:37:44.760
This is only a beginning. We've got
interesting times ahead of us.

4921
02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:45.660
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-Copenhagen Police.

4922
02:37:45.700 --> 02:37:46.390
-Do you know who she is?
-Yes.

4923
02:37:46.670 --> 02:37:48.350
Excuse me. A woman insists on
speaking to the person in charge.

4924
02:37:48.800 --> 02:37:49.890
-Is she in Sweden or Denmark?
-I don't know.

4925
02:37:50.160 --> 02:37:51.560
She's Swedish, and the car came
from Sweden. I assume I'm in charge.

4926
02:37:52.950 --> 02:37:54.090
-Saga Norén. Can I help you?
-When will you let traffic through?

4927
02:37:54.130 --> 02:37:55.190
-It might take up to two hours.
-I haven't got two hours!

4928
02:37:55.230 --> 02:37:55.990
-Back up.
-Is someone's life in danger?

4929
02:37:56.030 --> 02:37:56.800
There's a heart for my husband
in Copenhagen.

4930
02:37:56.840 --> 02:37:57.920
He needs a heart transplant.
Let us through.

4931
02:37:57.960 --> 02:37:58.910
He'll have to wait.
I can't let anyone through.

4932
02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:00.400
-What's happened?
-Is there no other way through?

4933
02:38:00.440 --> 02:38:01.440
There ought to be
another way through.

4934
02:38:01.480 --> 02:38:02.930
-No one's answering any questions.
-Let me pass, please.

4935
02:38:05.460 --> 02:38:06.770
The Öresund Bridge to Denmark
is closed.

4936
02:38:06.810 --> 02:38:07.690
According to the police it will...

4937
02:38:12.370 --> 02:38:13.610
-It's Stefan Lindberg.
-Hi, it's Veronika.

4938
02:38:13.650 --> 02:38:15.030
-Sorry, did I wake you up?
-No, you didn't. How are you?

4939
02:38:15.070 --> 02:38:16.260
I can't sleep.
I've got a stomach ache.

4940
02:38:16.300 --> 02:38:17.360
-I see. How are the boys?
-They're asleep.

4941
02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:18.440
They don't understand
what's about to happen.

4942
02:38:18.480 --> 02:38:19.760
-Can we meet up?
-Now?

4943
02:38:20.380 --> 02:38:21.230
Of course.
Do you want me to come over?

4944
02:38:21.660 --> 02:38:23.070
-No. I'd rather go to your place.
-OK.

4945
02:38:23.110 --> 02:38:24.050
-I can go to the office.
-I'll see you there.

4946
02:38:26.670 --> 02:38:27.700
Give me everything from
when the car came on to the bridge.

4947
02:38:27.740 --> 02:38:28.970
One camera records at a time.
They're started manually.

4948
02:38:29.010 --> 02:38:29.870
My colleague
might have recorded something.

4949
02:38:29.910 --> 02:38:30.940
Hello! Stop! Stop!

4950
02:38:30.980 --> 02:38:32.320
-Stop! Stop!
-I allowed it.

4951
02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:33.630
-Why? This is a crime scene.
-I'm fully aware of that.

4952
02:38:33.670 --> 02:38:34.420
-We've got enough bodies.
-He wasn't dying.

4953
02:38:34.460 --> 02:38:35.480
-Are you a doctor?
-No, I'm a police officer.

4954
02:38:36.070 --> 02:38:37.240
-What's your name?
-Martin Rohde.

4955
02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:38.180
-Rohde?
-R, O, H, D, E.

4956
02:38:38.220 --> 02:38:39.900
-Have you got an ID?
-It was an ambulance.

4957
02:38:39.940 --> 02:38:41.130
The Chairman
of Malmö City Council is dead.

4958
02:38:41.170 --> 02:38:42.470
-What evidence was destroyed?
-Probably none.

4959
02:38:42.510 --> 02:38:43.020
Thank you.

4960
02:38:49.460 --> 02:38:50.310
Hello. Hi. Finally.

4961
02:38:50.350 --> 02:38:51.760
I wont operate on Göran, Charlotte.
I had wine with my dinner.

4962
02:38:52.080 --> 02:38:53.650
-At what time? Are you drunk?
-No, but that doesn't matter.

4963
02:38:53.990 --> 02:38:54.970
You promised to see us through this.

4964
02:38:55.010 --> 02:38:56.090
-Morten Krag is a very good surgeon.
-Better than you?

4965
02:38:56.130 --> 02:38:57.000
I'll decide
who my husband's surgeon is!

4966
02:38:57.040 --> 02:38:58.510
-I wont forgive you if it goes wrong.
-What if I do it and it goes wrong?

4967
02:38:59.180 --> 02:39:00.070
Then I'll never forgive myself.

4968
02:39:03.970 --> 02:39:05.180
-We're done, you can move her.
-You can take her away.

4969
02:39:07.270 --> 02:39:07.800
Bloody hell.

4970
02:39:12.140 --> 02:39:13.290
The autopsy on Kerstin Ekwall
is being performed.

4971
02:39:13.330 --> 02:39:14.250
-And the recordings?
-They'll deliver them tomorrow.

4972
02:39:14.290 --> 02:39:15.050
-What about the press?
-They know.

4973
02:39:15.090 --> 02:39:16.150
The radio said that it was a woman.
They don't know who it is.

4974
02:39:16.190 --> 02:39:17.470
-And the family?
-I'm on my way to see them.

4975
02:39:17.510 --> 02:39:19.000
You'll wake them up, and there
are children there. Tread lightly.

4976
02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:20.590
In what sense? Oh. There aren't
that many ways to say it.

4977
02:39:20.630 --> 02:39:21.390
-Just tread lightly.
-Listen, Hans...

4978
02:39:21.430 --> 02:39:22.130
She was chopped in half.

4979
02:39:22.170 --> 02:39:23.240
-Right above the hips.
-What the hell are you saying?

4980
02:39:23.860 --> 02:39:25.320
She was due to attend a conference
in Copenhagen this morning.

4981
02:39:25.620 --> 02:39:26.680
-Have you got more computers?
-No.

4982
02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:27.610
Are you taking them?
The children's as well?

4983
02:39:27.650 --> 02:39:28.790
-When did you last talk to her?
-She called yesterday.

4984
02:39:29.010 --> 02:39:29.840
-Do you know what time it was?
-I don't know.

4985
02:39:30.070 --> 02:39:30.910
Around half past six in the evening.

4986
02:39:30.950 --> 02:39:31.750
-Was she threatened?
-By whom?

4987
02:39:31.790 --> 02:39:32.560
I didn't say that she was,
I asked you.

4988
02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:34.500
Not really. She was a politician,
there were some calls and emails.

4989
02:39:34.540 --> 02:39:35.990
-Has she upset anyone lately?
-Lately...

4990
02:39:36.230 --> 02:39:37.230
She wanted to charge for
library loans. Some disapproved.

4991
02:39:37.480 --> 02:39:38.250
-That's foolish.
-Sorry, what?

4992
02:39:38.290 --> 02:39:39.890
Reading becomes a money matter.
Social differences will grow.

4993
02:39:39.930 --> 02:39:40.850
-Is that why she was...?
-We don't know why.

4994
02:39:40.890 --> 02:39:41.630
It's unlikely
that library fees caused it.

4995
02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:42.880
Why? Why did someone do this?

4996
02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:44.570
Can you think of something personal?
Was she in debt? Did she use drugs?

4997
02:39:44.610 --> 02:39:45.340
Did she have an affair?

4998
02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:49.750
Saga Norén.

4999
02:39:50.220 --> 02:39:50.820
Can't we talk on the phone?

5000
02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:52.290
I'll be there in twenty minutes. Bye.

5001
02:40:03.710 --> 02:40:04.210
August?

5002
02:40:17.260 --> 02:40:18.050
-Were you on the bridge?
-Yes.

5003
02:40:18.090 --> 02:40:19.110
-What happened?
-A murder, the Swedes will handle it.

5004
02:40:19.380 --> 02:40:19.960
-Did you check on August?
-Yes.

5005
02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:20.880
-Is he asleep?
-Yes.

5006
02:40:20.920 --> 02:40:21.990
You promised to talk to him.
He's become a night owl.

5007
02:40:22.030 --> 02:40:22.800
Do you want me to
wake him up now?

5008
02:40:23.090 --> 02:40:24.430
-He got up at three o'clock today.
-I'll have a word with him tomorrow.

5009
02:40:27.420 --> 02:40:28.550
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

5010
02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:35.790
-Do you know the cause of death?
-I can make a qualified guess.

5011
02:40:35.830 --> 02:40:36.770
She died six to eight hours ago.

5012
02:40:36.810 --> 02:40:38.060
Yes, she called home at six thirty
and was dumped just after midnight.

5013
02:40:38.470 --> 02:40:39.280
There's something else.

5014
02:40:39.320 --> 02:40:39.960
-What?
-Take a look.

5015
02:40:47.140 --> 02:40:48.740
No livor mortis on the ears.
That's consistent with the bleeding.

5016
02:40:48.780 --> 02:40:49.490
Petechiae on the conjunctivas.

5017
02:40:50.270 --> 02:40:50.870
The face is swollen.

5018
02:40:51.960 --> 02:40:52.950
She was strangled
and cut in half after death.

5019
02:40:53.190 --> 02:40:53.750
And the other half?

5020
02:40:55.180 --> 02:40:56.370
The lower body is much paler.
A lot paler.

5021
02:40:57.030 --> 02:40:58.230
It's not coherent with the bleeding
or how the body was placed.

5022
02:40:59.350 --> 02:41:00.450
There's brown discoloration.
Frostbite?

5023
02:41:00.720 --> 02:41:01.870
It feels different. Frostbite.

5024
02:41:01.910 --> 02:41:02.630
Not frostbite, deep-freezing.

5025
02:41:02.670 --> 02:41:03.860
For about a year, I think.
I've never seen anything like this.

5026
02:41:03.900 --> 02:41:05.150
I don't know who they belong to.
They're not Kerstin Ekwall's legs.

5027
02:41:10.850 --> 02:41:11.730
-So everyone's here, then.
-Yes.

5028
02:41:11.770 --> 02:41:12.270
Hi, Sebastian.

5029
02:41:13.510 --> 02:41:14.090
I don't know what to do.

5030
02:41:14.130 --> 02:41:15.170
I'm worried about tomorrow.
I had to see you.

5031
02:41:15.210 --> 02:41:15.980
Can't you just pay the rent?

5032
02:41:16.020 --> 02:41:17.460
They can't evict the children.
Can they? Their friends are there.

5033
02:41:17.500 --> 02:41:18.300
I paid out money for the rent.

5034
02:41:18.880 --> 02:41:19.850
-Why did you bring the children?
-Sören wasn't there.

5035
02:41:20.270 --> 02:41:20.860
I can't manage.

5036
02:41:21.060 --> 02:41:22.270
-Can't you make an exception?
-No. You know I can't.

5037
02:41:22.310 --> 02:41:23.280
-Please.
-There are guidelines. I'm sorry.

5038
02:41:27.450 --> 02:41:28.730
Charlotte Söringer? I'm Frederik
Henriksen, hospital administrator.

5039
02:41:29.310 --> 02:41:30.610
-Göran had atrial fibrillation.
-They managed to stop it.

5040
02:41:30.650 --> 02:41:31.690
-He's to weak for surgery.
-Too weak?

5041
02:41:31.730 --> 02:41:32.910
-But there's a new heart.
-It will be given to someone else.

5042
02:41:33.280 --> 02:41:34.250
Anders said
that you need a new CT scanner.

5043
02:41:34.290 --> 02:41:35.870
My husband's business is doing well.
He's willing to donate a CT scanner.

5044
02:41:35.910 --> 02:41:36.680
We're cancelling for his own sake.

5045
02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:38.040
He'll die without a new heart.
I want both parties to benefit.

5046
02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:39.720
Pass my offer on
to the proper authority, please.

5047
02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:46.060
-Hello? Is this Martin Rohde?
-Yes.

5048
02:41:46.100 --> 02:41:47.230
-It's Saga Norén from the bridge.
-Yes, I remember.

5049
02:41:47.270 --> 02:41:48.920
-Were you asleep?
-I tend to doze off around this time.

5050
02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:49.810
-There were two women.
-You found another one.

5051
02:41:49.850 --> 02:41:50.780
The lower body
belonged to someone else.

5052
02:41:50.820 --> 02:41:52.080
-Have you found half a body?
-I don't know.

5053
02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:53.610
It could be more than a year ago.
The legs have been deep-frozen.

5054
02:41:53.650 --> 02:41:54.810
-Can you look into it? Now?
-First thing tomorrow morning.

5055
02:41:55.080 --> 02:41:56.030
Can someone else
look into it straight away?

5056
02:41:56.830 --> 02:41:57.760
-I'll call you back.
-When?

5057
02:41:59.650 --> 02:42:00.290
-Do you have to get up?
-Yes.

5058
02:42:07.220 --> 02:42:08.290
Missing woman, Caucasian,
at least a year ago...

5059
02:42:08.330 --> 02:42:08.990
-How old?
-Adult.

5060
02:42:09.240 --> 02:42:10.030
-And life in general is OK?
-Yes.

5061
02:42:10.070 --> 02:42:10.750
-What about you?
-I'm fine.

5062
02:42:11.230 --> 02:42:12.570
-So you'll be firing blanks.
-Was it in the staff news bulletin?

5063
02:42:12.610 --> 02:42:14.010
-Is everything working as it should?
-It will in time.

5064
02:42:14.050 --> 02:42:14.690
It can't be much fun.

5065
02:42:14.730 --> 02:42:15.920
-What do you mean?
-You've heard about castrated toms?

5066
02:42:16.220 --> 02:42:17.620
A wild predator turns into
a chunky sleepyhead. Just like that.

5067
02:42:18.210 --> 02:42:19.510
They're castrated,
that's not the same thing.

5068
02:42:19.990 --> 02:42:20.680
Let's see what we've got.

5069
02:42:21.360 --> 02:42:21.980
Two women killed a year apart.

5070
02:42:22.020 --> 02:42:23.230
One was deep-frozen.
They were dismembered.

5071
02:42:23.270 --> 02:42:24.890
And assembled on the bridge.
Someone wants to make a statement.

5072
02:42:27.020 --> 02:42:27.660
-Saga Norén.
-It's Martin.

5073
02:42:27.700 --> 02:42:29.160
The lower body is Monique Brammer,
I think. A missing 23-year-old.

5074
02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:29.970
-Can you email the info?
-I'll be right over.

5075
02:42:30.010 --> 02:42:30.990
-Why do you want to come here?
-She's Danish.

5076
02:42:31.030 --> 02:42:32.200
I was first on the scene.
Everyone's still asleep here.

5077
02:42:32.240 --> 02:42:33.070
-Do you mind if I come over?
-Yes.

5078
02:42:33.110 --> 02:42:34.230
Make sure I'm allowed in.
You've got my details.

5079
02:42:34.630 --> 02:42:36.110
Martin Rohde has probably identified
the second body. He's coming over.

5080
02:42:36.150 --> 02:42:37.280
-Is that a problem?
-Yes...

5081
02:42:37.630 --> 02:42:38.150
No, no.

5082
02:42:38.190 --> 02:42:39.640
If half of the body is Danish,
we have to cooperate.

5083
02:42:39.680 --> 02:42:40.410
I'll schedule a meeting
at half past five.

5084
02:42:40.450 --> 02:42:41.410
-Can you be ready by then?
-Yes.

5085
02:42:48.420 --> 02:42:48.990
It finally worked out.

5086
02:42:50.910 --> 02:42:52.480
-What did you just sign?
-Formalities.

5087
02:42:53.080 --> 02:42:54.140
-Whose is it?
-What?

5088
02:42:54.180 --> 02:42:54.770
The heart. Whose is it?

5089
02:42:54.810 --> 02:42:55.860
A man's. He's 25 or 26
and had a motorcycle accident.

5090
02:42:56.740 --> 02:42:58.080
-What's his name?
-I don't know. Does it matter?

5091
02:42:58.770 --> 02:42:59.750
No, I guess it doesn't.

5092
02:43:00.710 --> 02:43:02.060
-I'm scared.
-It will be fine.

5093
02:43:02.480 --> 02:43:03.840
Anders will operate, they're all
highly skilled. It will be fine.

5094
02:43:04.120 --> 02:43:04.770
I can't imagine life without you.

5095
02:43:05.590 --> 02:43:07.270
-I need to take Göran with me.
-Don't worry. You'll make it, honey.

5096
02:43:08.420 --> 02:43:09.030
-Hi.
-Hi.

5097
02:43:09.070 --> 02:43:09.870
-Hi! An early breakfast?
-No thank you.

5098
02:43:09.910 --> 02:43:11.280
-An email would have been faster.
-Yes, but not as pleasant.

5099
02:43:11.950 --> 02:43:13.040
-Where are you going?
-I'm coming in with you.

5100
02:43:13.460 --> 02:43:15.270
If it really is Monique Brammer,
we both have responsibilities.

5101
02:43:16.070 --> 02:43:16.990
Go straight on,
turn left, and register.

5102
02:43:19.660 --> 02:43:21.240
-Good morning. Coffee?
-No thanks, I've already had some.

5103
02:43:21.280 --> 02:43:22.610
I'm Martin Rohde.
I'll be working with Saga.

5104
02:43:22.650 --> 02:43:24.180
-Thank you. You need to register.
-I also need a card.

5105
02:43:24.220 --> 02:43:24.970
-My name's Felicia.
-Nice to meet you.

5106
02:43:25.430 --> 02:43:26.330
-That's it. This is for you.
-Thank you.

5107
02:43:26.370 --> 02:43:27.630
-And one of these is for you.
-Thanks! Ooh, Danish.

5108
02:43:28.650 --> 02:43:29.290
-See you later.
-I hope so.

5109
02:43:31.660 --> 02:43:33.150
-Where's Saga Norén?
-To the right. Bye!

5110
02:43:36.410 --> 02:43:37.030
Excuse me.

5111
02:43:37.070 --> 02:43:37.880
-Sit down.
-I'm afraid I can't.

5112
02:43:39.110 --> 02:43:40.400
-You make me nervous.
-OK, I can stand still.

5113
02:43:40.440 --> 02:43:41.720
-Why can't you sit down?
-My nether regions hurt.

5114
02:43:42.170 --> 02:43:43.520
-I had a vasectomy yesterday.
-Right.

5115
02:43:43.560 --> 02:43:44.390
I've got five children
with three different women.

5116
02:43:44.740 --> 02:43:45.740
-Have you got children?
-No, why would I want to?

5117
02:43:45.780 --> 02:43:46.850
-I've never heard anyone ask that.
-Many should have.

5118
02:43:48.020 --> 02:43:49.030
Not you,
I'm sure you're a wonderful dad.

5119
02:43:51.410 --> 02:43:52.710
-Why aren't you off sick?
-I can't afford it. August moved in.

5120
02:43:52.750 --> 02:43:54.500
Well, it's not really about money.
It was a small procedure, I can work.

5121
02:43:54.540 --> 02:43:55.400
-You can't sit down.
-I can.

5122
02:43:55.440 --> 02:43:56.510
-I drove here.
-Pretend that the chair is a car.

5123
02:43:58.260 --> 02:43:58.760
Yes.

5124
02:44:01.300 --> 02:44:02.370
-No one wanted to solve the case.
-What do you mean?

5125
02:44:02.410 --> 02:44:03.250
Monique Brammer
was reported missing.

5126
02:44:03.290 --> 02:44:04.780
Two prostitutes and a neighbour were
interviewed. The case was shelved.

5127
02:44:05.020 --> 02:44:05.680
It fell between two stools.

5128
02:44:05.720 --> 02:44:06.960
She disappeared, or she was killed.
They didn't find a body.

5129
02:44:07.380 --> 02:44:08.110
The case was
supposed to be shelved.

5130
02:44:08.150 --> 02:44:09.330
I'm surprised it took two weeks.
Come with me.

5131
02:44:12.630 --> 02:44:13.730
Do you think I should?
I tried painkillers, but...

5132
02:44:14.490 --> 02:44:15.300
-Two computers?
-They know who it is now.

5133
02:44:15.340 --> 02:44:16.100
-Will Saga handle the case, Hans?
-Yes.

5134
02:44:16.140 --> 02:44:17.030
-That's good.
-And a Danish police officer.

5135
02:44:17.070 --> 02:44:18.820
-Does he know that she's a bit odd?
-If not, he'll soon find out.

5136
02:44:20.240 --> 02:44:21.180
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

5137
02:44:21.220 --> 02:44:22.430
-This is Martin Röhde.
-It's Rohde.

5138
02:44:22.470 --> 02:44:23.730
Not as when you say "fur".
Rohde, Foure...

5139
02:44:24.600 --> 02:44:25.720
-Have you read the file?
-Most people have just arrived.

5140
02:44:25.760 --> 02:44:26.790
Half of two female bodies were found.
One was Kerstin Ekwall.

5141
02:44:26.830 --> 02:44:27.570
The other one has been deep-frozen.
Martin?

5142
02:44:27.610 --> 02:44:28.930
It's probably the 23-year-old
Monique Brammer from Copenhagen.

5143
02:44:28.970 --> 02:44:30.150
A prostitute and an addict
that went missing 13 months ago.

5144
02:44:30.800 --> 02:44:31.790
Do you want me to repeat that?
A bit slower?

5145
02:44:31.980 --> 02:44:32.940
Monique Brammer, 23 years old.
A prostitute and an addict.

5146
02:44:32.980 --> 02:44:33.840
She went missing 13 months ago.

5147
02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:35.410
-Right.
-The investigation was inadequate.

5148
02:44:36.230 --> 02:44:37.730
-Don't you agree?
-Yes. It was terrible.

5149
02:44:37.770 --> 02:44:38.840
But we found blood traces
in her apartment.

5150
02:44:38.880 --> 02:44:40.230
The samples are on their way
and can be compared to the body.

5151
02:44:40.270 --> 02:44:41.460
Before the bodies were dumped,
the power was cut for 48 seconds.

5152
02:44:41.500 --> 02:44:42.480
Their trying to trace the signal.
Can you help them, Gry?

5153
02:44:42.520 --> 02:44:43.500
-How was it done?
-Someone accessed a computer.

5154
02:44:43.540 --> 02:44:43.980
Can you show me the fourth picture?

5155
02:44:44.410 --> 02:44:45.020
Use all the people you need. Gry?

5156
02:44:45.060 --> 02:44:46.400
Here's Ekwall's mobile number.
Get the phone records.

5157
02:44:46.440 --> 02:44:47.540
Check her computers.
Talk to John about passwords.

5158
02:44:47.580 --> 02:44:48.450
Anne?
Find out where she was abducted.

5159
02:44:48.490 --> 02:44:49.680
She left work half past six.
She had a car. Find it!

5160
02:44:49.720 --> 02:44:51.120
-Were they dumped from her car?
-No, a black Cadillac Escalade.

5161
02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:52.580
The image where the bridge
is seen from above.

5162
02:44:52.620 --> 02:44:53.940
-John can find the license number.
-What? Sure.

5163
02:44:53.980 --> 02:44:54.930
-What are you doing?
-I had an idea.

5164
02:44:54.970 --> 02:44:56.460
The orange line the body was on...
We discussed where she was.

5165
02:44:56.500 --> 02:44:57.310
Here's the Swedish-Danish border.

5166
02:44:57.350 --> 02:44:58.410
One half is in Sweden,
one is in Denmark.

5167
02:44:58.450 --> 02:44:59.520
-It's millimetre perfect.
-Tell me everything about the line.

5168
02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:00.150
Take paint samples.

5169
02:45:00.190 --> 02:45:01.720
Power cut, body halves, a politician.
We'll be in the public eye.

5170
02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:11.730
-Hi. Is Veronika at home?
-Yes.

5171
02:45:11.770 --> 02:45:12.620
-What do you want?
-I would like to talk to her.

5172
02:45:12.660 --> 02:45:13.860
-You can talk to me.
-I would if you were clean.

5173
02:45:14.330 --> 02:45:15.040
-What? I am clean.
-Hi, Veronika.

5174
02:45:15.080 --> 02:45:16.520
-Isn't it enough to have us evicted?
-The landlord did that.

5175
02:45:16.950 --> 02:45:18.430
-You're not helping.
-I'm trying. I'm trying really hard.

5176
02:45:18.470 --> 02:45:19.930
If you had been more dependable,
you wouldn't have to move.

5177
02:45:20.910 --> 02:45:22.360
-That was bloody stupid.
-Sören! Stop it!

5178
02:45:24.460 --> 02:45:24.960
What the hell?

5179
02:45:26.510 --> 02:45:27.240
Stop, you bastard!

5180
02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:29.750
Stop! Come out!

5181
02:45:32.570 --> 02:45:33.410
Sören! Stop it, Sören! Stop it!

5182
02:45:33.450 --> 02:45:34.330
-I hate that bloody bastard!
-Sören!

5183
02:45:34.770 --> 02:45:36.070
He's caused trouble all along.
It makes me so angry!

5184
02:45:36.110 --> 02:45:37.580
Let go of me.
Go to hell, you bloody idiots.

5185
02:45:47.330 --> 02:45:48.140
-How's the operation going?
-It hasn't started.

5186
02:45:48.180 --> 02:45:49.270
-Why? He was prepared hours ago.
-I don't know.

5187
02:45:49.310 --> 02:45:50.000
I'm afraid I have to go.

5188
02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:51.530
-Don't you know where he is?
-You probably know better than me.

5189
02:45:51.570 --> 02:45:52.970
We'll call you if we hear from him...
Let's go.

5190
02:45:53.480 --> 02:45:54.700
-I'm sorry about all of this.
-Stop apologizing for him.

5191
02:45:55.430 --> 02:45:56.600
He's an adult
and makes his own decisions.

5192
02:45:56.640 --> 02:45:58.230
Maybe you should do the same?
Sören put you in this position.

5193
02:45:58.510 --> 02:45:59.810
You spend your money wisely,
but can't if you're not given any.

5194
02:46:00.300 --> 02:46:01.220
You don't get the chance
to care for your boys.

5195
02:46:01.740 --> 02:46:02.790
-He hits you and the children.
-Hardly ever the children.

5196
02:46:02.830 --> 02:46:03.820
Hardly ever? That's not good enough.

5197
02:46:04.180 --> 02:46:04.910
He shouldn't hit any of you.

5198
02:46:05.220 --> 02:46:06.860
You can get your life back on track.
Just you and the children.

5199
02:46:08.030 --> 02:46:08.900
Leave your husband
or nothing will change.

5200
02:46:09.670 --> 02:46:10.230
Think about it.

5201
02:46:13.260 --> 02:46:14.920
-Anders? What's going on?
-We've got a problem.

5202
02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:16.390
The donor was declared brain dead,
and a nurse spoke to his father.

5203
02:46:16.430 --> 02:46:17.750
The father changed his mind.
We can't have the heart. Göran!

5204
02:46:24.020 --> 02:46:24.650
Wasn't that the turn-off?

5205
02:46:25.220 --> 02:46:26.360
-Stefan? Wasn't that the turn-off?
-No, not today.

5206
02:46:26.980 --> 02:46:28.010
-Where are we going?
-You'll see.

5207
02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:36.880
Johan was nicknamed "The old bag".
He died a month ago.

5208
02:46:37.150 --> 02:46:38.750
No wife, no children, no debts,
no assets. The house was all he had.

5209
02:46:39.050 --> 02:46:39.760
It went to the local council.

5210
02:46:42.510 --> 02:46:43.010
It's Sören.

5211
02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:44.940
Come.

5212
02:46:52.990 --> 02:46:54.120
-Step inside.
-What about the children?

5213
02:46:54.160 --> 02:46:54.840
They can stay outside a while longer.

5214
02:46:56.280 --> 02:46:57.730
-Where are we? Why are we here?
-Just go inside.

5215
02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:02.090
-Crime scene and meeting place.
-Have you worked here a long time?

5216
02:47:02.130 --> 02:47:02.680
-More than ten years?
-Yes.

5217
02:47:02.720 --> 02:47:03.800
-Are you from around here?
-From Malmö? No.

5218
02:47:03.840 --> 02:47:05.560
I'm from Copenhagen.
I was born there.

5219
02:47:06.150 --> 02:47:08.040
No wonder Ingmar Bergman
and Lars Norén are from Sweden.

5220
02:47:08.250 --> 02:47:09.310
-Are you related to Lars Norén?
-No.

5221
02:47:09.650 --> 02:47:10.550
We need to find the meeting place
and the crime scene.

5222
02:47:10.590 --> 02:47:11.770
Where did the perpetrator
meet the victim?

5223
02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:16.430
I've spoken to Copenhagen.
You'll cooperate on the deaths.

5224
02:47:16.640 --> 02:47:17.470
Here's info about your authority.

5225
02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:18.670
I know what applies to me
in Denmark.

5226
02:47:19.310 --> 02:47:20.060
-Can I have a word with you, Saga?
-Yes.

5227
02:47:21.530 --> 02:47:22.450
The report you filed
against Martin...

5228
02:47:22.490 --> 02:47:23.120
Yes, there's only one.

5229
02:47:23.160 --> 02:47:24.130
What do you suggest I do with it?

5230
02:47:24.170 --> 02:47:25.130
Don't you think
it will affect your cooperation?

5231
02:47:25.410 --> 02:47:26.240
-Do you think so?
-I think there's every chance.

5232
02:47:26.430 --> 02:47:27.540
-Will he dislike me?
-That might happen.

5233
02:47:27.580 --> 02:47:29.100
Because of my report?
It doesn't have to affect the case.

5234
02:47:29.140 --> 02:47:30.140
He let an ambulance through.
No life was in danger.

5235
02:47:30.180 --> 02:47:31.150
-I'm supposed to file a report.
-I'll handle the report.

5236
02:47:31.190 --> 02:47:32.810
-Yes, that's fine. Fine.
-I've got the car's license number.

5237
02:47:32.850 --> 02:47:33.660
It belongs to Daniel Farbé in Malmö.

5238
02:47:33.700 --> 02:47:34.570
-The journalist?
-Yes, he's a journalist.

5239
02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:37.800
-Do you know who he is?
-Yes. I read his column.

5240
02:47:38.530 --> 02:47:39.090
It's entertaining.

5241
02:47:52.590 --> 02:47:53.990
-You made me jump.
-I worked all night.

5242
02:47:54.030 --> 02:47:55.220
-I'm done for the week. Berlin next.
-You work all night.

5243
02:47:55.260 --> 02:47:56.120
Then you get down in Berlin.
How do you manage?

5244
02:47:56.160 --> 02:47:57.290
Get down?
How many children have you got?

5245
02:47:57.330 --> 02:47:58.210
Children that suck the life
out of you.

5246
02:47:58.250 --> 02:47:59.900
I haven't got children. No one says
"get down" any more. No one.

5247
02:48:00.540 --> 02:48:01.190
-Have fun.
-I will.

5248
02:48:01.230 --> 02:48:01.900
I downloaded
"Elephants in the Desert".

5249
02:48:02.380 --> 02:48:02.970
What do you want, Åke?

5250
02:48:03.010 --> 02:48:04.070
A hug, an award, an applause?
Would you like one?

5251
02:48:04.660 --> 02:48:05.810
-They're really cool. I like them.
-Yes, they were cool.

5252
02:48:05.850 --> 02:48:07.240
What?
Two weeks ago you really liked them.

5253
02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:07.830
And now you like them.

5254
02:48:08.370 --> 02:48:08.900
My daughter...

5255
02:48:10.050 --> 02:48:11.020
-She danced all afternoon.
-Sorry, I have to answer.

5256
02:48:11.560 --> 02:48:12.400
We'll have to continue this later.

5257
02:48:14.270 --> 02:48:15.120
You and the boys will disappear.

5258
02:48:15.160 --> 02:48:16.020
Your paperwork
and your debts are gone.

5259
02:48:16.600 --> 02:48:17.760
You can make a fresh start.
Do you understand?

5260
02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:19.950
You can make a fresh start.
There's cash and a mobile here.

5261
02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:21.630
But you can never see or talk to
your husband again.

5262
02:48:22.170 --> 02:48:23.230
He's their dad.
I have to let them see him.

5263
02:48:23.270 --> 02:48:24.310
Why? Why do they have to?

5264
02:48:24.980 --> 02:48:26.550
To get another beating?
To be scared and broke?

5265
02:48:26.590 --> 02:48:28.110
Let him spend everything on drugs?
He'll ruin everything for you again.

5266
02:48:28.470 --> 02:48:29.170
People like him ruin things.

5267
02:48:29.910 --> 02:48:30.840
You don't know me.
Why are you doing this?

5268
02:48:33.230 --> 02:48:33.900
Because I can.

5269
02:48:45.360 --> 02:48:45.860
Bloody hell.

5270
02:48:54.060 --> 02:48:54.930
-Here's my car.
-Do you think it's him?

5271
02:48:54.970 --> 02:48:56.190
He kept a body in a freezer
and killed a politician.

5272
02:48:56.230 --> 02:48:57.280
-He wouldn't use his own car.
-Nice car.

5273
02:48:57.320 --> 02:48:58.580
-Is the Swedish police paid well?
-No, the same as in Denmark.

5274
02:48:58.620 --> 02:49:00.010
Don't jump to conclusions
about my wages based on my car.

5275
02:49:00.050 --> 02:49:01.300
Maybe it was a gift?
Maybe I inherited it or had savings?

5276
02:49:01.340 --> 02:49:02.570
I hope your professional conclusions
are more valid.

5277
02:49:02.610 --> 02:49:03.860
Read this.
It's Daniel Ferbé's latest column.

5278
02:49:03.900 --> 02:49:05.150
-The one that's a good writer?
-No, I said he's entertaining.

5279
02:49:05.190 --> 02:49:05.820
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

5280
02:49:18.390 --> 02:49:19.550
Hello? What's going on?

5281
02:49:19.590 --> 02:49:20.900
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-A Cadillac has a bomb in it.

5282
02:49:20.940 --> 02:49:21.940
Is it a black Escalade?
It's tied to a double homicide.

5283
02:49:21.980 --> 02:49:23.470
-Is the guy trying to kill himself?
-I don't think he was involved.

5284
02:49:23.510 --> 02:49:24.800
No, you're not going
anywhere near the place.

5285
02:49:32.310 --> 02:49:33.320
Help! Help!

5286
02:49:33.510 --> 02:49:34.210
-Take it easy.
-Please help me!

5287
02:49:34.250 --> 02:49:35.370
-Help me! Get me out!
-Calm down.

5288
02:49:37.170 --> 02:49:37.910
-Help me!
-The windshield is wired in.

5289
02:49:37.950 --> 02:49:38.900
The side windows are
connected to the electrical system.

5290
02:49:38.940 --> 02:49:40.330
The glass seems OK,
but there are wires everywhere.

5291
02:49:42.300 --> 02:49:42.970
We've got his contact details.

5292
02:49:47.310 --> 02:49:48.260
-What's going on?
-My mobile!

5293
02:49:48.300 --> 02:49:49.500
-Yes?
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

5294
02:49:49.540 --> 02:49:50.910
I need to know whether you were
on the bridge last night.

5295
02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:52.010
-What?
-Were you on the Öresund Bridge?

5296
02:49:52.050 --> 02:49:53.120
I was working.
I was here all the time.

5297
02:49:53.490 --> 02:49:54.490
-How will you get me out?
-I don't know, that's not my job.

5298
02:49:54.530 --> 02:49:55.600
-Do you know Kerstin Ekwall?
-Who?

5299
02:49:55.640 --> 02:49:56.530
Daniel? Did you do anything
apart from turn the key?

5300
02:49:56.570 --> 02:49:57.910
No. Everything locked.
The countdown started.

5301
02:49:57.950 --> 02:49:58.740
-Hello?
-I'm talking to the bomb guy.

5302
02:49:58.780 --> 02:49:59.550
Chairman of the City Council
Kerstin Ekwall.

5303
02:49:59.590 --> 02:50:01.040
-Have you written about her?
-No, I don't know.

5304
02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:02.160
-Have you been tipped off about her?
-No! What is this?

5305
02:50:02.200 --> 02:50:02.860
Get me out! Please!

5306
02:50:02.900 --> 02:50:04.020
Does anyone else
have a key to your car?

5307
02:50:04.060 --> 02:50:05.460
-No, I don't know.
-Can you reach it?

5308
02:50:05.500 --> 02:50:06.380
I don't want to die. Please.

5309
02:50:06.420 --> 02:50:07.700
-I don't want it to end like this.
-Daniel? You need to talk to me.

5310
02:50:08.890 --> 02:50:10.280
It skipped a minute.
What the hell did you do?

5311
02:50:10.490 --> 02:50:12.070
It was three, now it's two.
It was three.

5312
02:50:12.560 --> 02:50:13.490
Come one, hurry up.

5313
02:50:13.530 --> 02:50:14.790
Where are you going?
Stay here! Please!

5314
02:50:15.390 --> 02:50:16.980
Please! Come back!
Where are you going?

5315
02:50:20.250 --> 02:50:21.630
You need to talk to me.
Daniel? Daniel?

5316
02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:22.600
Is it a big bomb?

5317
02:50:23.540 --> 02:50:24.700
-I think so.
-You're not religious, right?

5318
02:50:24.740 --> 02:50:25.410
You're an atheist?

5319
02:50:25.450 --> 02:50:26.970
Everything will just stop. The body
won't have time to register pain.

5320
02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:29.500
-Are you sure?
-Don't look at the clock. Listen.

5321
02:50:29.540 --> 02:50:30.940
Do you know why your car
was used to dump two bodies?

5322
02:50:31.620 --> 02:50:32.430
-No.
-Think about it. Focus.

5323
02:50:32.470 --> 02:50:33.850
-Who did this to you?
-I've slagged so many people off.

5324
02:50:37.010 --> 02:50:38.070
Daniel? Are you still there? Hello?

5325
02:50:44.920 --> 02:50:45.440
It's clean.

5326
02:50:47.340 --> 02:50:48.500
Sorry about the drama, it's hard
to make oneself heard today.

5327
02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:49.320
I assume I have your attention now.

5328
02:50:49.360 --> 02:50:50.960
Our part of the world would be
wonderful if we solved our problems.

5329
02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:51.830
I would like to
point out five in particular.

5330
02:50:51.870 --> 02:50:53.490
This is only a beginning. We've got
interesting times ahead of us.

5331
02:50:53.490 --> 02:50:54.390
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-Copenhagen Police.

5332
02:50:54.430 --> 02:50:55.120
-Do you know who she is?
-Yes.

5333
02:50:55.400 --> 02:50:57.080
Excuse me. A woman insists on
speaking to the person in charge.

5334
02:50:57.530 --> 02:50:58.620
-Is she in Sweden or Denmark?
-I don't know.

5335
02:50:58.890 --> 02:51:00.290
She's Swedish, and the car came
from Sweden. I assume I'm in charge.

5336
02:51:01.680 --> 02:51:02.820
-Saga Norén. Can I help you?
-When will you let traffic through?

5337
02:51:02.860 --> 02:51:03.920
-It might take up to two hours.
-I haven't got two hours!

5338
02:51:03.960 --> 02:51:04.720
-Back up.
-Is someone's life in danger?

5339
02:51:04.760 --> 02:51:05.530
There's a heart for my husband
in Copenhagen.

5340
02:51:05.570 --> 02:51:06.650
He needs a heart transplant.
Let us through.

5341
02:51:06.690 --> 02:51:07.640
He'll have to wait.
I can't let anyone through.

5342
02:51:08.010 --> 02:51:09.130
-What's happened?
-Is there no other way through?

5343
02:51:09.170 --> 02:51:10.170
There ought to be
another way through.

5344
02:51:10.210 --> 02:51:11.660
-No one's answering any questions.
-Let me pass, please.

5345
02:51:14.190 --> 02:51:15.500
The Öresund Bridge to Denmark
is closed.

5346
02:51:15.540 --> 02:51:16.420
According to the police it will...

5347
02:51:21.100 --> 02:51:22.340
-It's Stefan Lindberg.
-Hi, it's Veronika.

5348
02:51:22.380 --> 02:51:23.760
-Sorry, did I wake you up?
-No, you didn't. How are you?

5349
02:51:23.800 --> 02:51:24.990
I can't sleep.
I've got a stomach ache.

5350
02:51:25.030 --> 02:51:26.090
-I see. How are the boys?
-They're asleep.

5351
02:51:26.130 --> 02:51:27.170
They don't understand
what's about to happen.

5352
02:51:27.210 --> 02:51:28.490
-Can we meet up?
-Now?

5353
02:51:29.110 --> 02:51:29.960
Of course.
Do you want me to come over?

5354
02:51:30.390 --> 02:51:31.800
-No. I'd rather go to your place.
-OK.

5355
02:51:31.840 --> 02:51:32.780
-I can go to the office.
-I'll see you there.

5356
02:51:35.400 --> 02:51:36.430
Give me everything from
when the car came on to the bridge.

5357
02:51:36.470 --> 02:51:37.700
One camera records at a time.
They're started manually.

5358
02:51:37.740 --> 02:51:38.600
My colleague
might have recorded something.

5359
02:51:38.640 --> 02:51:39.670
Hello! Stop! Stop!

5360
02:51:39.710 --> 02:51:41.050
-Stop! Stop!
-I allowed it.

5361
02:51:41.090 --> 02:51:42.360
-Why? This is a crime scene.
-I'm fully aware of that.

5362
02:51:42.400 --> 02:51:43.150
-We've got enough bodies.
-He wasn't dying.

5363
02:51:43.190 --> 02:51:44.210
-Are you a doctor?
-No, I'm a police officer.

5364
02:51:44.800 --> 02:51:45.970
-What's your name?
-Martin Rohde.

5365
02:51:46.010 --> 02:51:46.910
-Rohde?
-R, O, H, D, E.

5366
02:51:46.950 --> 02:51:48.630
-Have you got an ID?
-It was an ambulance.

5367
02:51:48.670 --> 02:51:49.860
The Chairman
of Malmö City Council is dead.

5368
02:51:49.900 --> 02:51:51.200
-What evidence was destroyed?
-Probably none.

5369
02:51:51.240 --> 02:51:51.750
Thank you.

5370
02:51:58.190 --> 02:51:59.040
Hello. Hi. Finally.

5371
02:51:59.080 --> 02:52:00.490
I wont operate on Göran, Charlotte.
I had wine with my dinner.

5372
02:52:00.810 --> 02:52:02.380
-At what time? Are you drunk?
-No, but that doesn't matter.

5373
02:52:02.720 --> 02:52:03.700
You promised to see us through this.

5374
02:52:03.740 --> 02:52:04.820
-Morten Krag is a very good surgeon.
-Better than you?

5375
02:52:04.860 --> 02:52:05.730
I'll decide
who my husband's surgeon is!

5376
02:52:05.770 --> 02:52:07.240
-I wont forgive you if it goes wrong.
-What if I do it and it goes wrong?

5377
02:52:07.910 --> 02:52:08.800
Then I'll never forgive myself.

5378
02:52:12.700 --> 02:52:13.910
-We're done, you can move her.
-You can take her away.

5379
02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:16.530
Bloody hell.

5380
02:52:20.870 --> 02:52:22.020
The autopsy on Kerstin Ekwall
is being performed.

5381
02:52:22.060 --> 02:52:22.980
-And the recordings?
-They'll deliver them tomorrow.

5382
02:52:23.020 --> 02:52:23.780
-What about the press?
-They know.

5383
02:52:23.820 --> 02:52:24.880
The radio said that it was a woman.
They don't know who it is.

5384
02:52:24.920 --> 02:52:26.200
-And the family?
-I'm on my way to see them.

5385
02:52:26.240 --> 02:52:27.730
You'll wake them up, and there
are children there. Tread lightly.

5386
02:52:27.770 --> 02:52:29.320
In what sense? Oh. There aren't
that many ways to say it.

5387
02:52:29.360 --> 02:52:30.120
-Just tread lightly.
-Listen, Hans...

5388
02:52:30.160 --> 02:52:30.860
She was chopped in half.

5389
02:52:30.900 --> 02:52:31.970
-Right above the hips.
-What the hell are you saying?

5390
02:52:32.590 --> 02:52:34.050
She was due to attend a conference
in Copenhagen this morning.

5391
02:52:34.350 --> 02:52:35.410
-Have you got more computers?
-No.

5392
02:52:35.450 --> 02:52:36.340
Are you taking them?
The children's as well?

5393
02:52:36.380 --> 02:52:37.520
-When did you last talk to her?
-She called yesterday.

5394
02:52:37.740 --> 02:52:38.570
-Do you know what time it was?
-I don't know.

5395
02:52:38.800 --> 02:52:39.640
Around half past six in the evening.

5396
02:52:39.680 --> 02:52:40.480
-Was she threatened?
-By whom?

5397
02:52:40.520 --> 02:52:41.290
I didn't say that she was,
I asked you.

5398
02:52:41.570 --> 02:52:43.230
Not really. She was a politician,
there were some calls and emails.

5399
02:52:43.270 --> 02:52:44.720
-Has she upset anyone lately?
-Lately...

5400
02:52:44.960 --> 02:52:45.960
She wanted to charge for
library loans. Some disapproved.

5401
02:52:46.210 --> 02:52:46.980
-That's foolish.
-Sorry, what?

5402
02:52:47.020 --> 02:52:48.620
Reading becomes a money matter.
Social differences will grow.

5403
02:52:48.660 --> 02:52:49.580
-Is that why she was...?
-We don't know why.

5404
02:52:49.620 --> 02:52:50.360
It's unlikely
that library fees caused it.

5405
02:52:50.730 --> 02:52:51.610
Why? Why did someone do this?

5406
02:52:51.650 --> 02:52:53.300
Can you think of something personal?
Was she in debt? Did she use drugs?

5407
02:52:53.340 --> 02:52:54.070
Did she have an affair?

5408
02:52:57.890 --> 02:52:58.480
Saga Norén.

5409
02:52:58.950 --> 02:52:59.550
Can't we talk on the phone?

5410
02:53:00.090 --> 02:53:01.020
I'll be there in twenty minutes. Bye.

5411
02:53:12.440 --> 02:53:12.940
August?

5412
02:53:25.990 --> 02:53:26.780
-Were you on the bridge?
-Yes.

5413
02:53:26.820 --> 02:53:27.840
-What happened?
-A murder, the Swedes will handle it.

5414
02:53:28.110 --> 02:53:28.690
-Did you check on August?
-Yes.

5415
02:53:28.730 --> 02:53:29.610
-Is he asleep?
-Yes.

5416
02:53:29.650 --> 02:53:30.720
You promised to talk to him.
He's become a night owl.

5417
02:53:30.760 --> 02:53:31.530
Do you want me to
wake him up now?

5418
02:53:31.820 --> 02:53:33.160
-He got up at three o'clock today.
-I'll have a word with him tomorrow.

5419
02:53:36.150 --> 02:53:37.280
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

5420
02:53:43.050 --> 02:53:44.520
-Do you know the cause of death?
-I can make a qualified guess.

5421
02:53:44.560 --> 02:53:45.500
She died six to eight hours ago.

5422
02:53:45.540 --> 02:53:46.790
Yes, she called home at six thirty
and was dumped just after midnight.

5423
02:53:47.200 --> 02:53:48.010
There's something else.

5424
02:53:48.050 --> 02:53:48.690
-What?
-Take a look.

5425
02:53:55.870 --> 02:53:57.470
No livor mortis on the ears.
That's consistent with the bleeding.

5426
02:53:57.510 --> 02:53:58.220
Petechiae on the conjunctivas.

5427
02:53:59.000 --> 02:53:59.600
The face is swollen.

5428
02:54:00.690 --> 02:54:01.680
She was strangled
and cut in half after death.

5429
02:54:01.920 --> 02:54:02.480
And the other half?

5430
02:54:03.910 --> 02:54:05.100
The lower body is much paler.
A lot paler.

5431
02:54:05.760 --> 02:54:06.960
It's not coherent with the bleeding
or how the body was placed.

5432
02:54:08.080 --> 02:54:09.180
There's brown discoloration.
Frostbite?

5433
02:54:09.450 --> 02:54:10.600
It feels different. Frostbite.

5434
02:54:10.640 --> 02:54:11.360
Not frostbite, deep-freezing.

5435
02:54:11.400 --> 02:54:12.590
For about a year, I think.
I've never seen anything like this.

5436
02:54:12.630 --> 02:54:13.880
I don't know who they belong to.
They're not Kerstin Ekwall's legs.

5437
02:54:19.580 --> 02:54:20.460
-So everyone's here, then.
-Yes.

5438
02:54:20.500 --> 02:54:21.000
Hi, Sebastian.

5439
02:54:22.240 --> 02:54:22.820
I don't know what to do.

5440
02:54:22.860 --> 02:54:23.900
I'm worried about tomorrow.
I had to see you.

5441
02:54:23.940 --> 02:54:24.710
Can't you just pay the rent?

5442
02:54:24.750 --> 02:54:26.190
They can't evict the children.
Can they? Their friends are there.

5443
02:54:26.230 --> 02:54:27.030
I paid out money for the rent.

5444
02:54:27.610 --> 02:54:28.580
-Why did you bring the children?
-Sören wasn't there.

5445
02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:29.590
I can't manage.

5446
02:54:29.790 --> 02:54:31.000
-Can't you make an exception?
-No. You know I can't.

5447
02:54:31.040 --> 02:54:32.010
-Please.
-There are guidelines. I'm sorry.

5448
02:54:36.180 --> 02:54:37.460
Charlotte Söringer? I'm Frederik
Henriksen, hospital administrator.

5449
02:54:38.040 --> 02:54:39.340
-Göran had atrial fibrillation.
-They managed to stop it.

5450
02:54:39.380 --> 02:54:40.420
-He's to weak for surgery.
-Too weak?

5451
02:54:40.460 --> 02:54:41.640
-But there's a new heart.
-It will be given to someone else.

5452
02:54:42.010 --> 02:54:42.980
Anders said
that you need a new CT scanner.

5453
02:54:43.020 --> 02:54:44.600
My husband's business is doing well.
He's willing to donate a CT scanner.

5454
02:54:44.640 --> 02:54:45.410
We're cancelling for his own sake.

5455
02:54:45.450 --> 02:54:46.770
He'll die without a new heart.
I want both parties to benefit.

5456
02:54:46.810 --> 02:54:48.450
Pass my offer on
to the proper authority, please.

5457
02:54:54.090 --> 02:54:54.790
-Hello? Is this Martin Rohde?
-Yes.

5458
02:54:54.830 --> 02:54:55.960
-It's Saga Norén from the bridge.
-Yes, I remember.

5459
02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:57.650
-Were you asleep?
-I tend to doze off around this time.

5460
02:54:57.690 --> 02:54:58.540
-There were two women.
-You found another one.

5461
02:54:58.580 --> 02:54:59.510
The lower body
belonged to someone else.

5462
02:54:59.550 --> 02:55:00.810
-Have you found half a body?
-I don't know.

5463
02:55:00.850 --> 02:55:02.340
It could be more than a year ago.
The legs have been deep-frozen.

5464
02:55:02.380 --> 02:55:03.540
-Can you look into it? Now?
-First thing tomorrow morning.

5465
02:55:03.810 --> 02:55:04.760
Can someone else
look into it straight away?

5466
02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:06.490
-I'll call you back.
-When?

5467
02:55:08.380 --> 02:55:09.020
-Do you have to get up?
-Yes.

5468
02:55:15.950 --> 02:55:17.020
Missing woman, Caucasian,
at least a year ago...

5469
02:55:17.060 --> 02:55:17.720
-How old?
-Adult.

5470
02:55:17.970 --> 02:55:18.760
-And life in general is OK?
-Yes.

5471
02:55:18.800 --> 02:55:19.480
-What about you?
-I'm fine.

5472
02:55:19.960 --> 02:55:21.300
-So you'll be firing blanks.
-Was it in the staff news bulletin?

5473
02:55:21.340 --> 02:55:22.740
-Is everything working as it should?
-It will in time.

5474
02:55:22.780 --> 02:55:23.420
It can't be much fun.

5475
02:55:23.460 --> 02:55:24.650
-What do you mean?
-You've heard about castrated toms?

5476
02:55:24.950 --> 02:55:26.350
A wild predator turns into
a chunky sleepyhead. Just like that.

5477
02:55:26.940 --> 02:55:28.240
They're castrated,
that's not the same thing.

5478
02:55:28.720 --> 02:55:29.410
Let's see what we've got.

5479
02:55:30.090 --> 02:55:30.710
Two women killed a year apart.

5480
02:55:30.750 --> 02:55:31.960
One was deep-frozen.
They were dismembered.

5481
02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:33.620
And assembled on the bridge.
Someone wants to make a statement.

5482
02:55:35.750 --> 02:55:36.390
-Saga Norén.
-It's Martin.

5483
02:55:36.430 --> 02:55:37.890
The lower body is Monique Brammer,
I think. A missing 23-year-old.

5484
02:55:37.930 --> 02:55:38.700
-Can you email the info?
-I'll be right over.

5485
02:55:38.740 --> 02:55:39.720
-Why do you want to come here?
-She's Danish.

5486
02:55:39.760 --> 02:55:40.930
I was first on the scene.
Everyone's still asleep here.

5487
02:55:40.970 --> 02:55:41.800
-Do you mind if I come over?
-Yes.

5488
02:55:41.840 --> 02:55:42.960
Make sure I'm allowed in.
You've got my details.

5489
02:55:43.360 --> 02:55:44.840
Martin Rohde has probably identified
the second body. He's coming over.

5490
02:55:44.880 --> 02:55:46.010
-Is that a problem?
-Yes...

5491
02:55:46.360 --> 02:55:46.880
No, no.

5492
02:55:46.920 --> 02:55:48.370
If half of the body is Danish,
we have to cooperate.

5493
02:55:48.410 --> 02:55:49.140
I'll schedule a meeting
at half past five.

5494
02:55:49.180 --> 02:55:50.140
-Can you be ready by then?
-Yes.

5495
02:55:57.150 --> 02:55:57.720
It finally worked out.

5496
02:55:59.640 --> 02:56:01.210
-What did you just sign?
-Formalities.

5497
02:56:01.810 --> 02:56:02.870
-Whose is it?
-What?

5498
02:56:02.910 --> 02:56:03.500
The heart. Whose is it?

5499
02:56:03.540 --> 02:56:04.590
A man's. He's 25 or 26
and had a motorcycle accident.

5500
02:56:05.470 --> 02:56:06.810
-What's his name?
-I don't know. Does it matter?

5501
02:56:07.500 --> 02:56:08.480
No, I guess it doesn't.

5502
02:56:09.440 --> 02:56:10.790
-I'm scared.
-It will be fine.

5503
02:56:11.210 --> 02:56:12.570
Anders will operate, they're all
highly skilled. It will be fine.

5504
02:56:12.850 --> 02:56:13.500
I can't imagine life without you.

5505
02:56:14.320 --> 02:56:16.000
-I need to take Göran with me.
-Don't worry. You'll make it, honey.

5506
02:56:17.150 --> 02:56:17.760
-Hi.
-Hi.

5507
02:56:17.800 --> 02:56:18.600
-Hi! An early breakfast?
-No thank you.

5508
02:56:18.640 --> 02:56:20.010
-An email would have been faster.
-Yes, but not as pleasant.

5509
02:56:20.680 --> 02:56:21.770
-Where are you going?
-I'm coming in with you.

5510
02:56:22.190 --> 02:56:24.000
If it really is Monique Brammer,
we both have responsibilities.

5511
02:56:24.800 --> 02:56:25.720
Go straight on,
turn left, and register.

5512
02:56:28.390 --> 02:56:29.970
-Good morning. Coffee?
-No thanks, I've already had some.

5513
02:56:30.010 --> 02:56:31.340
I'm Martin Rohde.
I'll be working with Saga.

5514
02:56:31.380 --> 02:56:32.910
-Thank you. You need to register.
-I also need a card.

5515
02:56:32.950 --> 02:56:33.700
-My name's Felicia.
-Nice to meet you.

5516
02:56:34.160 --> 02:56:35.060
-That's it. This is for you.
-Thank you.

5517
02:56:35.100 --> 02:56:36.360
-And one of these is for you.
-Thanks! Ooh, Danish.

5518
02:56:37.380 --> 02:56:38.020
-See you later.
-I hope so.

5519
02:56:40.390 --> 02:56:41.880
-Where's Saga Norén?
-To the right. Bye!

5520
02:56:45.140 --> 02:56:45.760
Excuse me.

5521
02:56:45.800 --> 02:56:46.610
-Sit down.
-I'm afraid I can't.

5522
02:56:47.840 --> 02:56:49.130
-You make me nervous.
-OK, I can stand still.

5523
02:56:49.170 --> 02:56:50.450
-Why can't you sit down?
-My nether regions hurt.

5524
02:56:50.900 --> 02:56:52.250
-I had a vasectomy yesterday.
-Right.

5525
02:56:52.290 --> 02:56:53.120
I've got five children
with three different women.

5526
02:56:53.470 --> 02:56:54.470
-Have you got children?
-No, why would I want to?

5527
02:56:54.510 --> 02:56:55.580
-I've never heard anyone ask that.
-Many should have.

5528
02:56:56.750 --> 02:56:57.760
Not you,
I'm sure you're a wonderful dad.

5529
02:57:00.140 --> 02:57:01.440
-Why aren't you off sick?
-I can't afford it. August moved in.

5530
02:57:01.480 --> 02:57:03.230
Well, it's not really about money.
It was a small procedure, I can work.

5531
02:57:03.270 --> 02:57:04.130
-You can't sit down.
-I can.

5532
02:57:04.170 --> 02:57:05.240
-I drove here.
-Pretend that the chair is a car.

5533
02:57:06.990 --> 02:57:07.490
Yes.

5534
02:57:10.030 --> 02:57:11.100
-No one wanted to solve the case.
-What do you mean?

5535
02:57:11.140 --> 02:57:11.980
Monique Brammer
was reported missing.

5536
02:57:12.020 --> 02:57:13.510
Two prostitutes and a neighbour were
interviewed. The case was shelved.

5537
02:57:13.750 --> 02:57:14.410
It fell between two stools.

5538
02:57:14.450 --> 02:57:15.690
She disappeared, or she was killed.
They didn't find a body.

5539
02:57:16.110 --> 02:57:16.840
The case was
supposed to be shelved.

5540
02:57:16.880 --> 02:57:18.060
I'm surprised it took two weeks.
Come with me.

5541
02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:22.460
Do you think I should?
I tried painkillers, but...

5542
02:57:23.220 --> 02:57:24.030
-Two computers?
-They know who it is now.

5543
02:57:24.070 --> 02:57:24.830
-Will Saga handle the case, Hans?
-Yes.

5544
02:57:24.870 --> 02:57:25.760
-That's good.
-And a Danish police officer.

5545
02:57:25.800 --> 02:57:27.550
-Does he know that she's a bit odd?
-If not, he'll soon find out.

5546
02:57:28.970 --> 02:57:29.910
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

5547
02:57:29.950 --> 02:57:31.160
-This is Martin Röhde.
-It's Rohde.

5548
02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:32.460
Not as when you say "fur".
Rohde, Foure...

5549
02:57:33.330 --> 02:57:34.450
-Have you read the file?
-Most people have just arrived.

5550
02:57:34.490 --> 02:57:35.520
Half of two female bodies were found.
One was Kerstin Ekwall.

5551
02:57:35.560 --> 02:57:36.300
The other one has been deep-frozen.
Martin?

5552
02:57:36.340 --> 02:57:37.660
It's probably the 23-year-old
Monique Brammer from Copenhagen.

5553
02:57:37.700 --> 02:57:38.880
A prostitute and an addict
that went missing 13 months ago.

5554
02:57:39.530 --> 02:57:40.520
Do you want me to repeat that?
A bit slower?

5555
02:57:40.710 --> 02:57:41.670
Monique Brammer, 23 years old.
A prostitute and an addict.

5556
02:57:41.710 --> 02:57:42.570
She went missing 13 months ago.

5557
02:57:42.610 --> 02:57:44.140
-Right.
-The investigation was inadequate.

5558
02:57:44.960 --> 02:57:46.460
-Don't you agree?
-Yes. It was terrible.

5559
02:57:46.500 --> 02:57:47.570
But we found blood traces
in her apartment.

5560
02:57:47.610 --> 02:57:48.960
The samples are on their way
and can be compared to the body.

5561
02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:50.190
Before the bodies were dumped,
the power was cut for 48 seconds.

5562
02:57:50.230 --> 02:57:51.210
Their trying to trace the signal.
Can you help them, Gry?

5563
02:57:51.250 --> 02:57:52.230
-How was it done?
-Someone accessed a computer.

5564
02:57:52.270 --> 02:57:52.710
Can you show me the fourth picture?

5565
02:57:53.140 --> 02:57:53.750
Use all the people you need. Gry?

5566
02:57:53.790 --> 02:57:55.130
Here's Ekwall's mobile number.
Get the phone records.

5567
02:57:55.170 --> 02:57:56.270
Check her computers.
Talk to John about passwords.

5568
02:57:56.310 --> 02:57:57.180
Anne?
Find out where she was abducted.

5569
02:57:57.220 --> 02:57:58.410
She left work half past six.
She had a car. Find it!

5570
02:57:58.450 --> 02:57:59.850
-Were they dumped from her car?
-No, a black Cadillac Escalade.

5571
02:57:59.890 --> 02:58:01.310
The image where the bridge
is seen from above.

5572
02:58:01.350 --> 02:58:02.670
-John can find the license number.
-What? Sure.

5573
02:58:02.710 --> 02:58:03.660
-What are you doing?
-I had an idea.

5574
02:58:03.700 --> 02:58:05.190
The orange line the body was on...
We discussed where she was.

5575
02:58:05.230 --> 02:58:06.040
Here's the Swedish-Danish border.

5576
02:58:06.080 --> 02:58:07.140
One half is in Sweden,
one is in Denmark.

5577
02:58:07.180 --> 02:58:08.250
-It's millimetre perfect.
-Tell me everything about the line.

5578
02:58:08.290 --> 02:58:08.880
Take paint samples.

5579
02:58:08.920 --> 02:58:10.450
Power cut, body halves, a politician.
We'll be in the public eye.

5580
02:58:18.970 --> 02:58:20.460
-Hi. Is Veronika at home?
-Yes.

5581
02:58:20.500 --> 02:58:21.350
-What do you want?
-I would like to talk to her.

5582
02:58:21.390 --> 02:58:22.590
-You can talk to me.
-I would if you were clean.

5583
02:58:23.060 --> 02:58:23.770
-What? I am clean.
-Hi, Veronika.

5584
02:58:23.810 --> 02:58:25.250
-Isn't it enough to have us evicted?
-The landlord did that.

5585
02:58:25.680 --> 02:58:27.160
-You're not helping.
-I'm trying. I'm trying really hard.

5586
02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:28.660
If you had been more dependable,
you wouldn't have to move.

5587
02:58:29.640 --> 02:58:31.090
-That was bloody stupid.
-Sören! Stop it!

5588
02:58:33.190 --> 02:58:33.690
What the hell?

5589
02:58:35.240 --> 02:58:35.970
Stop, you bastard!

5590
02:58:37.890 --> 02:58:38.480
Stop! Come out!

5591
02:58:41.300 --> 02:58:42.140
Sören! Stop it, Sören! Stop it!

5592
02:58:42.180 --> 02:58:43.060
-I hate that bloody bastard!
-Sören!

5593
02:58:43.500 --> 02:58:44.800
He's caused trouble all along.
It makes me so angry!

5594
02:58:44.840 --> 02:58:46.310
Let go of me.
Go to hell, you bloody idiots.

5595
02:58:56.060 --> 02:58:56.870
-How's the operation going?
-It hasn't started.

5596
02:58:56.910 --> 02:58:58.000
-Why? He was prepared hours ago.
-I don't know.

5597
02:58:58.040 --> 02:58:58.730
I'm afraid I have to go.

5598
02:58:58.770 --> 02:59:00.260
-Don't you know where he is?
-You probably know better than me.

5599
02:59:00.300 --> 02:59:01.700
We'll call you if we hear from him...
Let's go.

5600
02:59:02.210 --> 02:59:03.430
-I'm sorry about all of this.
-Stop apologizing for him.

5601
02:59:04.160 --> 02:59:05.330
He's an adult
and makes his own decisions.

5602
02:59:05.370 --> 02:59:06.960
Maybe you should do the same?
Sören put you in this position.

5603
02:59:07.240 --> 02:59:08.540
You spend your money wisely,
but can't if you're not given any.

5604
02:59:09.030 --> 02:59:09.950
You don't get the chance
to care for your boys.

5605
02:59:10.470 --> 02:59:11.520
-He hits you and the children.
-Hardly ever the children.

5606
02:59:11.560 --> 02:59:12.550
Hardly ever? That's not good enough.

5607
02:59:12.910 --> 02:59:13.640
He shouldn't hit any of you.

5608
02:59:13.950 --> 02:59:15.590
You can get your life back on track.
Just you and the children.

5609
02:59:16.760 --> 02:59:17.630
Leave your husband
or nothing will change.

5610
02:59:18.400 --> 02:59:18.960
Think about it.

5611
02:59:21.990 --> 02:59:23.650
-Anders? What's going on?
-We've got a problem.

5612
02:59:23.690 --> 02:59:25.120
The donor was declared brain dead,
and a nurse spoke to his father.

5613
02:59:25.160 --> 02:59:26.480
The father changed his mind.
We can't have the heart. Göran!

5614
02:59:32.750 --> 02:59:33.380
Wasn't that the turn-off?

5615
02:59:33.950 --> 02:59:35.090
-Stefan? Wasn't that the turn-off?
-No, not today.

5616
02:59:35.710 --> 02:59:36.740
-Where are we going?
-You'll see.

5617
02:59:44.010 --> 02:59:45.610
Johan was nicknamed "The old bag".
He died a month ago.

5618
02:59:45.880 --> 02:59:47.480
No wife, no children, no debts,
no assets. The house was all he had.

5619
02:59:47.780 --> 02:59:48.490
It went to the local council.

5620
02:59:51.240 --> 02:59:51.740
It's Sören.

5621
02:59:53.170 --> 02:59:53.670
Come.

5622
03:00:01.720 --> 03:00:02.850
-Step inside.
-What about the children?

5623
03:00:02.890 --> 03:00:03.570
They can stay outside a while longer.

5624
03:00:05.010 --> 03:00:06.460
-Where are we? Why are we here?
-Just go inside.

5625
03:00:09.370 --> 03:00:10.820
-Crime scene and meeting place.
-Have you worked here a long time?

5626
03:00:10.860 --> 03:00:11.410
-More than ten years?
-Yes.

5627
03:00:11.450 --> 03:00:12.530
-Are you from around here?
-From Malmö? No.

5628
03:00:12.570 --> 03:00:14.290
I'm from Copenhagen.
I was born there.

5629
03:00:14.880 --> 03:00:16.770
No wonder Ingmar Bergman
and Lars Norén are from Sweden.

5630
03:00:16.980 --> 03:00:18.040
-Are you related to Lars Norén?
-No.

5631
03:00:18.380 --> 03:00:19.280
We need to find the meeting place
and the crime scene.

5632
03:00:19.320 --> 03:00:20.500
Where did the perpetrator
meet the victim?

5633
03:00:23.930 --> 03:00:25.160
I've spoken to Copenhagen.
You'll cooperate on the deaths.

5634
03:00:25.370 --> 03:00:26.200
Here's info about your authority.

5635
03:00:26.240 --> 03:00:27.400
I know what applies to me
in Denmark.

5636
03:00:28.040 --> 03:00:28.790
-Can I have a word with you, Saga?
-Yes.

5637
03:00:30.260 --> 03:00:31.180
The report you filed
against Martin...

5638
03:00:31.220 --> 03:00:31.850
Yes, there's only one.

5639
03:00:31.890 --> 03:00:32.860
What do you suggest I do with it?

5640
03:00:32.900 --> 03:00:33.860
Don't you think
it will affect your cooperation?

5641
03:00:34.140 --> 03:00:34.970
-Do you think so?
-I think there's every chance.

5642
03:00:35.160 --> 03:00:36.270
-Will he dislike me?
-That might happen.

5643
03:00:36.310 --> 03:00:37.830
Because of my report?
It doesn't have to affect the case.

5644
03:00:37.870 --> 03:00:38.870
He let an ambulance through.
No life was in danger.

5645
03:00:38.910 --> 03:00:39.880
-I'm supposed to file a report.
-I'll handle the report.

5646
03:00:39.920 --> 03:00:41.540
-Yes, that's fine. Fine.
-I've got the car's license number.

5647
03:00:41.580 --> 03:00:42.390
It belongs to Daniel Farbé in Malmö.

5648
03:00:42.430 --> 03:00:43.300
-The journalist?
-Yes, he's a journalist.

5649
03:00:45.250 --> 03:00:46.530
-Do you know who he is?
-Yes. I read his column.

5650
03:00:47.260 --> 03:00:47.820
It's entertaining.

5651
03:01:01.320 --> 03:01:02.720
-You made me jump.
-I worked all night.

5652
03:01:02.760 --> 03:01:03.950
-I'm done for the week. Berlin next.
-You work all night.

5653
03:01:03.990 --> 03:01:04.850
Then you get down in Berlin.
How do you manage?

5654
03:01:04.890 --> 03:01:06.020
Get down?
How many children have you got?

5655
03:01:06.060 --> 03:01:06.940
Children that suck the life
out of you.

5656
03:01:06.980 --> 03:01:08.630
I haven't got children. No one says
"get down" any more. No one.

5657
03:01:09.270 --> 03:01:09.920
-Have fun.
-I will.

5658
03:01:09.960 --> 03:01:10.630
I downloaded
"Elephants in the Desert".

5659
03:01:11.110 --> 03:01:11.700
What do you want, Åke?

5660
03:01:11.740 --> 03:01:12.800
A hug, an award, an applause?
Would you like one?

5661
03:01:13.390 --> 03:01:14.540
-They're really cool. I like them.
-Yes, they were cool.

5662
03:01:14.580 --> 03:01:15.970
What?
Two weeks ago you really liked them.

5663
03:01:16.010 --> 03:01:16.560
And now you like them.

5664
03:01:17.100 --> 03:01:17.630
My daughter...

5665
03:01:18.780 --> 03:01:19.750
-She danced all afternoon.
-Sorry, I have to answer.

5666
03:01:20.290 --> 03:01:21.130
We'll have to continue this later.

5667
03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:23.850
You and the boys will disappear.

5668
03:01:23.890 --> 03:01:24.750
Your paperwork
and your debts are gone.

5669
03:01:25.330 --> 03:01:26.490
You can make a fresh start.
Do you understand?

5670
03:01:26.930 --> 03:01:28.680
You can make a fresh start.
There's cash and a mobile here.

5671
03:01:29.170 --> 03:01:30.360
But you can never see or talk to
your husband again.

5672
03:01:30.900 --> 03:01:31.960
He's their dad.
I have to let them see him.

5673
03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:33.040
Why? Why do they have to?

5674
03:01:33.710 --> 03:01:35.280
To get another beating?
To be scared and broke?

5675
03:01:35.320 --> 03:01:36.840
Let him spend everything on drugs?
He'll ruin everything for you again.

5676
03:01:37.200 --> 03:01:37.900
People like him ruin things.

5677
03:01:38.640 --> 03:01:39.570
You don't know me.
Why are you doing this?

5678
03:01:41.960 --> 03:01:42.630
Because I can.

5679
03:01:54.090 --> 03:01:54.590
Bloody hell.

5680
03:02:02.790 --> 03:02:03.660
-Here's my car.
-Do you think it's him?

5681
03:02:03.700 --> 03:02:04.920
He kept a body in a freezer
and killed a politician.

5682
03:02:04.960 --> 03:02:06.010
-He wouldn't use his own car.
-Nice car.

5683
03:02:06.050 --> 03:02:07.310
-Is the Swedish police paid well?
-No, the same as in Denmark.

5684
03:02:07.350 --> 03:02:08.740
Don't jump to conclusions
about my wages based on my car.

5685
03:02:08.780 --> 03:02:10.030
Maybe it was a gift?
Maybe I inherited it or had savings?

5686
03:02:10.070 --> 03:02:11.300
I hope your professional conclusions
are more valid.

5687
03:02:11.340 --> 03:02:12.590
Read this.
It's Daniel Ferbé's latest column.

5688
03:02:12.630 --> 03:02:13.880
-The one that's a good writer?
-No, I said he's entertaining.

5689
03:02:13.920 --> 03:02:14.550
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

5690
03:02:27.120 --> 03:02:28.280
Hello? What's going on?

5691
03:02:28.320 --> 03:02:29.630
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-A Cadillac has a bomb in it.

5692
03:02:29.670 --> 03:02:30.670
Is it a black Escalade?
It's tied to a double homicide.

5693
03:02:30.710 --> 03:02:32.200
-Is the guy trying to kill himself?
-I don't think he was involved.

5694
03:02:32.240 --> 03:02:33.530
No, you're not going
anywhere near the place.

5695
03:02:41.040 --> 03:02:42.050
Help! Help!

5696
03:02:42.240 --> 03:02:42.940
-Take it easy.
-Please help me!

5697
03:02:42.980 --> 03:02:44.100
-Help me! Get me out!
-Calm down.

5698
03:02:45.900 --> 03:02:46.640
-Help me!
-The windshield is wired in.

5699
03:02:46.680 --> 03:02:47.630
The side windows are
connected to the electrical system.

5700
03:02:47.670 --> 03:02:49.060
The glass seems OK,
but there are wires everywhere.

5701
03:02:51.030 --> 03:02:51.700
We've got his contact details.

5702
03:02:56.040 --> 03:02:56.990
-What's going on?
-My mobile!

5703
03:02:57.030 --> 03:02:58.230
-Yes?
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

5704
03:02:58.270 --> 03:02:59.640
I need to know whether you were
on the bridge last night.

5705
03:02:59.930 --> 03:03:00.740
-What?
-Were you on the Öresund Bridge?

5706
03:03:00.780 --> 03:03:01.850
I was working.
I was here all the time.

5707
03:03:02.220 --> 03:03:03.220
-How will you get me out?
-I don't know, that's not my job.

5708
03:03:03.260 --> 03:03:04.330
-Do you know Kerstin Ekwall?
-Who?

5709
03:03:04.370 --> 03:03:05.260
Daniel? Did you do anything
apart from turn the key?

5710
03:03:05.300 --> 03:03:06.640
No. Everything locked.
The countdown started.

5711
03:03:06.680 --> 03:03:07.470
-Hello?
-I'm talking to the bomb guy.

5712
03:03:07.510 --> 03:03:08.280
Chairman of the City Council
Kerstin Ekwall.

5713
03:03:08.320 --> 03:03:09.770
-Have you written about her?
-No, I don't know.

5714
03:03:09.810 --> 03:03:10.890
-Have you been tipped off about her?
-No! What is this?

5715
03:03:10.930 --> 03:03:11.590
Get me out! Please!

5716
03:03:11.630 --> 03:03:12.750
Does anyone else
have a key to your car?

5717
03:03:12.790 --> 03:03:14.190
-No, I don't know.
-Can you reach it?

5718
03:03:14.230 --> 03:03:15.110
I don't want to die. Please.

5719
03:03:15.150 --> 03:03:16.430
-I don't want it to end like this.
-Daniel? You need to talk to me.

5720
03:03:17.620 --> 03:03:19.010
It skipped a minute.
What the hell did you do?

5721
03:03:19.220 --> 03:03:20.800
It was three, now it's two.
It was three.

5722
03:03:21.290 --> 03:03:22.220
Come one, hurry up.

5723
03:03:22.260 --> 03:03:23.520
Where are you going?
Stay here! Please!

5724
03:03:24.120 --> 03:03:25.710
Please! Come back!
Where are you going?

5725
03:03:28.980 --> 03:03:30.360
You need to talk to me.
Daniel? Daniel?

5726
03:03:30.770 --> 03:03:31.330
Is it a big bomb?

5727
03:03:32.270 --> 03:03:33.430
-I think so.
-You're not religious, right?

5728
03:03:33.470 --> 03:03:34.140
You're an atheist?

5729
03:03:34.180 --> 03:03:35.700
Everything will just stop. The body
won't have time to register pain.

5730
03:03:36.810 --> 03:03:38.230
-Are you sure?
-Don't look at the clock. Listen.

5731
03:03:38.270 --> 03:03:39.670
Do you know why your car
was used to dump two bodies?

5732
03:03:40.350 --> 03:03:41.160
-No.
-Think about it. Focus.

5733
03:03:41.200 --> 03:03:42.580
-Who did this to you?
-I've slagged so many people off.

5734
03:03:45.740 --> 03:03:46.800
Daniel? Are you still there? Hello?

5735
03:03:53.650 --> 03:03:54.170
It's clean.

5736
03:03:56.070 --> 03:03:57.230
Sorry about the drama, it's hard
to make oneself heard today.

5737
03:03:57.270 --> 03:03:58.050
I assume I have your attention now.

5738
03:03:58.090 --> 03:03:59.690
Our part of the world would be
wonderful if we solved our problems.

5739
03:03:59.730 --> 03:04:00.560
I would like to
point out five in particular.

5740
03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:02.220
This is only a beginning. We've got
interesting times ahead of us.

5741
03:04:02.220 --> 03:04:03.120
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-Copenhagen Police.

5742
03:04:03.160 --> 03:04:03.850
-Do you know who she is?
-Yes.

5743
03:04:04.130 --> 03:04:05.810
Excuse me. A woman insists on
speaking to the person in charge.

5744
03:04:06.260 --> 03:04:07.350
-Is she in Sweden or Denmark?
-I don't know.

5745
03:04:07.620 --> 03:04:09.020
She's Swedish, and the car came
from Sweden. I assume I'm in charge.

5746
03:04:10.410 --> 03:04:11.550
-Saga Norén. Can I help you?
-When will you let traffic through?

5747
03:04:11.590 --> 03:04:12.650
-It might take up to two hours.
-I haven't got two hours!

5748
03:04:12.690 --> 03:04:13.450
-Back up.
-Is someone's life in danger?

5749
03:04:13.490 --> 03:04:14.260
There's a heart for my husband
in Copenhagen.

5750
03:04:14.300 --> 03:04:15.380
He needs a heart transplant.
Let us through.

5751
03:04:15.420 --> 03:04:16.370
He'll have to wait.
I can't let anyone through.

5752
03:04:16.740 --> 03:04:17.860
-What's happened?
-Is there no other way through?

5753
03:04:17.900 --> 03:04:18.900
There ought to be
another way through.

5754
03:04:18.940 --> 03:04:20.390
-No one's answering any questions.
-Let me pass, please.

5755
03:04:22.920 --> 03:04:24.230
The Öresund Bridge to Denmark
is closed.

5756
03:04:24.270 --> 03:04:25.150
According to the police it will...

5757
03:04:29.830 --> 03:04:31.070
-It's Stefan Lindberg.
-Hi, it's Veronika.

5758
03:04:31.110 --> 03:04:32.490
-Sorry, did I wake you up?
-No, you didn't. How are you?

5759
03:04:32.530 --> 03:04:33.720
I can't sleep.
I've got a stomach ache.

5760
03:04:33.760 --> 03:04:34.820
-I see. How are the boys?
-They're asleep.

5761
03:04:34.860 --> 03:04:35.900
They don't understand
what's about to happen.

5762
03:04:35.940 --> 03:04:37.220
-Can we meet up?
-Now?

5763
03:04:37.840 --> 03:04:38.690
Of course.
Do you want me to come over?

5764
03:04:39.120 --> 03:04:40.530
-No. I'd rather go to your place.
-OK.

5765
03:04:40.570 --> 03:04:41.510
-I can go to the office.
-I'll see you there.

5766
03:04:44.130 --> 03:04:45.160
Give me everything from
when the car came on to the bridge.

5767
03:04:45.200 --> 03:04:46.430
One camera records at a time.
They're started manually.

5768
03:04:46.470 --> 03:04:47.330
My colleague
might have recorded something.

5769
03:04:47.370 --> 03:04:48.400
Hello! Stop! Stop!

5770
03:04:48.440 --> 03:04:49.780
-Stop! Stop!
-I allowed it.

5771
03:04:49.820 --> 03:04:51.090
-Why? This is a crime scene.
-I'm fully aware of that.

5772
03:04:51.130 --> 03:04:51.880
-We've got enough bodies.
-He wasn't dying.

5773
03:04:51.920 --> 03:04:52.940
-Are you a doctor?
-No, I'm a police officer.

5774
03:04:53.530 --> 03:04:54.700
-What's your name?
-Martin Rohde.

5775
03:04:54.740 --> 03:04:55.640
-Rohde?
-R, O, H, D, E.

5776
03:04:55.680 --> 03:04:57.360
-Have you got an ID?
-It was an ambulance.

5777
03:04:57.400 --> 03:04:58.590
The Chairman
of Malmö City Council is dead.

5778
03:04:58.630 --> 03:04:59.930
-What evidence was destroyed?
-Probably none.

5779
03:04:59.970 --> 03:05:00.480
Thank you.

5780
03:05:06.920 --> 03:05:07.770
Hello. Hi. Finally.

5781
03:05:07.810 --> 03:05:09.220
I wont operate on Göran, Charlotte.
I had wine with my dinner.

5782
03:05:09.540 --> 03:05:11.110
-At what time? Are you drunk?
-No, but that doesn't matter.

5783
03:05:11.450 --> 03:05:12.430
You promised to see us through this.

5784
03:05:12.470 --> 03:05:13.550
-Morten Krag is a very good surgeon.
-Better than you?

5785
03:05:13.590 --> 03:05:14.460
I'll decide
who my husband's surgeon is!

5786
03:05:14.500 --> 03:05:15.970
-I wont forgive you if it goes wrong.
-What if I do it and it goes wrong?

5787
03:05:16.640 --> 03:05:17.530
Then I'll never forgive myself.

5788
03:05:21.430 --> 03:05:22.640
-We're done, you can move her.
-You can take her away.

5789
03:05:24.730 --> 03:05:25.260
Bloody hell.

5790
03:05:29.600 --> 03:05:30.750
The autopsy on Kerstin Ekwall
is being performed.

5791
03:05:30.790 --> 03:05:31.710
-And the recordings?
-They'll deliver them tomorrow.

5792
03:05:31.750 --> 03:05:32.510
-What about the press?
-They know.

5793
03:05:32.550 --> 03:05:33.610
The radio said that it was a woman.
They don't know who it is.

5794
03:05:33.650 --> 03:05:34.930
-And the family?
-I'm on my way to see them.

5795
03:05:34.970 --> 03:05:36.460
You'll wake them up, and there
are children there. Tread lightly.

5796
03:05:36.500 --> 03:05:38.050
In what sense? Oh. There aren't
that many ways to say it.

5797
03:05:38.090 --> 03:05:38.850
-Just tread lightly.
-Listen, Hans...

5798
03:05:38.890 --> 03:05:39.590
She was chopped in half.

5799
03:05:39.630 --> 03:05:40.700
-Right above the hips.
-What the hell are you saying?

5800
03:05:41.320 --> 03:05:42.780
She was due to attend a conference
in Copenhagen this morning.

5801
03:05:43.080 --> 03:05:44.140
-Have you got more computers?
-No.

5802
03:05:44.180 --> 03:05:45.070
Are you taking them?
The children's as well?

5803
03:05:45.110 --> 03:05:46.250
-When did you last talk to her?
-She called yesterday.

5804
03:05:46.470 --> 03:05:47.300
-Do you know what time it was?
-I don't know.

5805
03:05:47.530 --> 03:05:48.370
Around half past six in the evening.

5806
03:05:48.410 --> 03:05:49.210
-Was she threatened?
-By whom?

5807
03:05:49.250 --> 03:05:50.020
I didn't say that she was,
I asked you.

5808
03:05:50.300 --> 03:05:51.960
Not really. She was a politician,
there were some calls and emails.

5809
03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:53.450
-Has she upset anyone lately?
-Lately...

5810
03:05:53.690 --> 03:05:54.690
She wanted to charge for
library loans. Some disapproved.

5811
03:05:54.940 --> 03:05:55.710
-That's foolish.
-Sorry, what?

5812
03:05:55.750 --> 03:05:57.350
Reading becomes a money matter.
Social differences will grow.

5813
03:05:57.390 --> 03:05:58.310
-Is that why she was...?
-We don't know why.

5814
03:05:58.350 --> 03:05:59.090
It's unlikely
that library fees caused it.

5815
03:05:59.460 --> 03:06:00.340
Why? Why did someone do this?

5816
03:06:00.380 --> 03:06:02.030
Can you think of something personal?
Was she in debt? Did she use drugs?

5817
03:06:02.070 --> 03:06:02.800
Did she have an affair?

5818
03:06:06.620 --> 03:06:07.210
Saga Norén.

5819
03:06:07.680 --> 03:06:08.280
Can't we talk on the phone?

5820
03:06:08.820 --> 03:06:09.750
I'll be there in twenty minutes. Bye.

5821
03:06:21.170 --> 03:06:21.670
August?

5822
03:06:34.720 --> 03:06:35.510
-Were you on the bridge?
-Yes.

5823
03:06:35.550 --> 03:06:36.570
-What happened?
-A murder, the Swedes will handle it.

5824
03:06:36.840 --> 03:06:37.420
-Did you check on August?
-Yes.

5825
03:06:37.460 --> 03:06:38.340
-Is he asleep?
-Yes.

5826
03:06:38.380 --> 03:06:39.450
You promised to talk to him.
He's become a night owl.

5827
03:06:39.490 --> 03:06:40.260
Do you want me to
wake him up now?

5828
03:06:40.550 --> 03:06:41.890
-He got up at three o'clock today.
-I'll have a word with him tomorrow.

5829
03:06:44.880 --> 03:06:46.010
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

5830
03:06:51.780 --> 03:06:53.250
-Do you know the cause of death?
-I can make a qualified guess.

5831
03:06:53.290 --> 03:06:54.230
She died six to eight hours ago.

5832
03:06:54.270 --> 03:06:55.520
Yes, she called home at six thirty
and was dumped just after midnight.

5833
03:06:55.930 --> 03:06:56.740
There's something else.

5834
03:06:56.780 --> 03:06:57.420
-What?
-Take a look.

5835
03:07:04.600 --> 03:07:06.200
No livor mortis on the ears.
That's consistent with the bleeding.

5836
03:07:06.240 --> 03:07:06.950
Petechiae on the conjunctivas.

5837
03:07:07.730 --> 03:07:08.330
The face is swollen.

5838
03:07:09.420 --> 03:07:10.410
She was strangled
and cut in half after death.

5839
03:07:10.650 --> 03:07:11.210
And the other half?

5840
03:07:12.640 --> 03:07:13.830
The lower body is much paler.
A lot paler.

5841
03:07:14.490 --> 03:07:15.690
It's not coherent with the bleeding
or how the body was placed.

5842
03:07:16.810 --> 03:07:17.910
There's brown discoloration.
Frostbite?

5843
03:07:18.180 --> 03:07:19.330
It feels different. Frostbite.

5844
03:07:19.370 --> 03:07:20.090
Not frostbite, deep-freezing.

5845
03:07:20.130 --> 03:07:21.320
For about a year, I think.
I've never seen anything like this.

5846
03:07:21.360 --> 03:07:22.610
I don't know who they belong to.
They're not Kerstin Ekwall's legs.

5847
03:07:28.310 --> 03:07:29.190
-So everyone's here, then.
-Yes.

5848
03:07:29.230 --> 03:07:29.730
Hi, Sebastian.

5849
03:07:30.970 --> 03:07:31.550
I don't know what to do.

5850
03:07:31.590 --> 03:07:32.630
I'm worried about tomorrow.
I had to see you.

5851
03:07:32.670 --> 03:07:33.440
Can't you just pay the rent?

5852
03:07:33.480 --> 03:07:34.920
They can't evict the children.
Can they? Their friends are there.

5853
03:07:34.960 --> 03:07:35.760
I paid out money for the rent.

5854
03:07:36.340 --> 03:07:37.310
-Why did you bring the children?
-Sören wasn't there.

5855
03:07:37.730 --> 03:07:38.320
I can't manage.

5856
03:07:38.520 --> 03:07:39.730
-Can't you make an exception?
-No. You know I can't.

5857
03:07:39.770 --> 03:07:40.740
-Please.
-There are guidelines. I'm sorry.

5858
03:07:44.910 --> 03:07:46.190
Charlotte Söringer? I'm Frederik
Henriksen, hospital administrator.

5859
03:07:46.770 --> 03:07:48.070
-Göran had atrial fibrillation.
-They managed to stop it.

5860
03:07:48.110 --> 03:07:49.150
-He's to weak for surgery.
-Too weak?

5861
03:07:49.190 --> 03:07:50.370
-But there's a new heart.
-It will be given to someone else.

5862
03:07:50.740 --> 03:07:51.710
Anders said
that you need a new CT scanner.

5863
03:07:51.750 --> 03:07:53.330
My husband's business is doing well.
He's willing to donate a CT scanner.

5864
03:07:53.370 --> 03:07:54.140
We're cancelling for his own sake.

5865
03:07:54.180 --> 03:07:55.500
He'll die without a new heart.
I want both parties to benefit.

5866
03:07:55.540 --> 03:07:57.180
Pass my offer on
to the proper authority, please.

5867
03:08:02.820 --> 03:08:03.520
-Hello? Is this Martin Rohde?
-Yes.

5868
03:08:03.560 --> 03:08:04.690
-It's Saga Norén from the bridge.
-Yes, I remember.

5869
03:08:04.730 --> 03:08:06.380
-Were you asleep?
-I tend to doze off around this time.

5870
03:08:06.420 --> 03:08:07.270
-There were two women.
-You found another one.

5871
03:08:07.310 --> 03:08:08.240
The lower body
belonged to someone else.

5872
03:08:08.280 --> 03:08:09.540
-Have you found half a body?
-I don't know.

5873
03:08:09.580 --> 03:08:11.070
It could be more than a year ago.
The legs have been deep-frozen.

5874
03:08:11.110 --> 03:08:12.270
-Can you look into it? Now?
-First thing tomorrow morning.

5875
03:08:12.540 --> 03:08:13.490
Can someone else
look into it straight away?

5876
03:08:14.290 --> 03:08:15.220
-I'll call you back.
-When?

5877
03:08:17.110 --> 03:08:17.750
-Do you have to get up?
-Yes.

5878
03:08:24.680 --> 03:08:25.750
Missing woman, Caucasian,
at least a year ago...

5879
03:08:25.790 --> 03:08:26.450
-How old?
-Adult.

5880
03:08:26.700 --> 03:08:27.490
-And life in general is OK?
-Yes.

5881
03:08:27.530 --> 03:08:28.210
-What about you?
-I'm fine.

5882
03:08:28.690 --> 03:08:30.030
-So you'll be firing blanks.
-Was it in the staff news bulletin?

5883
03:08:30.070 --> 03:08:31.470
-Is everything working as it should?
-It will in time.

5884
03:08:31.510 --> 03:08:32.150
It can't be much fun.

5885
03:08:32.190 --> 03:08:33.380
-What do you mean?
-You've heard about castrated toms?

5886
03:08:33.680 --> 03:08:35.080
A wild predator turns into
a chunky sleepyhead. Just like that.

5887
03:08:35.670 --> 03:08:36.970
They're castrated,
that's not the same thing.

5888
03:08:37.450 --> 03:08:38.140
Let's see what we've got.

5889
03:08:38.820 --> 03:08:39.440
Two women killed a year apart.

5890
03:08:39.480 --> 03:08:40.690
One was deep-frozen.
They were dismembered.

5891
03:08:40.730 --> 03:08:42.350
And assembled on the bridge.
Someone wants to make a statement.

5892
03:08:44.480 --> 03:08:45.120
-Saga Norén.
-It's Martin.

5893
03:08:45.160 --> 03:08:46.620
The lower body is Monique Brammer,
I think. A missing 23-year-old.

5894
03:08:46.660 --> 03:08:47.430
-Can you email the info?
-I'll be right over.

5895
03:08:47.470 --> 03:08:48.450
-Why do you want to come here?
-She's Danish.

5896
03:08:48.490 --> 03:08:49.660
I was first on the scene.
Everyone's still asleep here.

5897
03:08:49.700 --> 03:08:50.530
-Do you mind if I come over?
-Yes.

5898
03:08:50.570 --> 03:08:51.690
Make sure I'm allowed in.
You've got my details.

5899
03:08:52.090 --> 03:08:53.570
Martin Rohde has probably identified
the second body. He's coming over.

5900
03:08:53.610 --> 03:08:54.740
-Is that a problem?
-Yes...

5901
03:08:55.090 --> 03:08:55.610
No, no.

5902
03:08:55.650 --> 03:08:57.100
If half of the body is Danish,
we have to cooperate.

5903
03:08:57.140 --> 03:08:57.870
I'll schedule a meeting
at half past five.

5904
03:08:57.910 --> 03:08:58.870
-Can you be ready by then?
-Yes.

5905
03:09:05.880 --> 03:09:06.450
It finally worked out.

5906
03:09:08.370 --> 03:09:09.940
-What did you just sign?
-Formalities.

5907
03:09:10.540 --> 03:09:11.600
-Whose is it?
-What?

5908
03:09:11.640 --> 03:09:12.230
The heart. Whose is it?

5909
03:09:12.270 --> 03:09:13.320
A man's. He's 25 or 26
and had a motorcycle accident.

5910
03:09:14.200 --> 03:09:15.540
-What's his name?
-I don't know. Does it matter?

5911
03:09:16.230 --> 03:09:17.210
No, I guess it doesn't.

5912
03:09:18.170 --> 03:09:19.520
-I'm scared.
-It will be fine.

5913
03:09:19.940 --> 03:09:21.300
Anders will operate, they're all
highly skilled. It will be fine.

5914
03:09:21.580 --> 03:09:22.230
I can't imagine life without you.

5915
03:09:23.050 --> 03:09:24.730
-I need to take Göran with me.
-Don't worry. You'll make it, honey.

5916
03:09:25.880 --> 03:09:26.490
-Hi.
-Hi.

5917
03:09:26.530 --> 03:09:27.330
-Hi! An early breakfast?
-No thank you.

5918
03:09:27.370 --> 03:09:28.740
-An email would have been faster.
-Yes, but not as pleasant.

5919
03:09:29.410 --> 03:09:30.500
-Where are you going?
-I'm coming in with you.

5920
03:09:30.920 --> 03:09:32.730
If it really is Monique Brammer,
we both have responsibilities.

5921
03:09:33.530 --> 03:09:34.450
Go straight on,
turn left, and register.

5922
03:09:37.120 --> 03:09:38.700
-Good morning. Coffee?
-No thanks, I've already had some.

5923
03:09:38.740 --> 03:09:40.070
I'm Martin Rohde.
I'll be working with Saga.

5924
03:09:40.110 --> 03:09:41.640
-Thank you. You need to register.
-I also need a card.

5925
03:09:41.680 --> 03:09:42.430
-My name's Felicia.
-Nice to meet you.

5926
03:09:42.890 --> 03:09:43.790
-That's it. This is for you.
-Thank you.

5927
03:09:43.830 --> 03:09:45.090
-And one of these is for you.
-Thanks! Ooh, Danish.

5928
03:09:46.110 --> 03:09:46.750
-See you later.
-I hope so.

5929
03:09:49.120 --> 03:09:50.610
-Where's Saga Norén?
-To the right. Bye!

5930
03:09:53.870 --> 03:09:54.490
Excuse me.

5931
03:09:54.530 --> 03:09:55.340
-Sit down.
-I'm afraid I can't.

5932
03:09:56.570 --> 03:09:57.860
-You make me nervous.
-OK, I can stand still.

5933
03:09:57.900 --> 03:09:59.180
-Why can't you sit down?
-My nether regions hurt.

5934
03:09:59.630 --> 03:10:00.980
-I had a vasectomy yesterday.
-Right.

5935
03:10:01.020 --> 03:10:01.850
I've got five children
with three different women.

5936
03:10:02.200 --> 03:10:03.200
-Have you got children?
-No, why would I want to?

5937
03:10:03.240 --> 03:10:04.310
-I've never heard anyone ask that.
-Many should have.

5938
03:10:05.480 --> 03:10:06.490
Not you,
I'm sure you're a wonderful dad.

5939
03:10:08.870 --> 03:10:10.170
-Why aren't you off sick?
-I can't afford it. August moved in.

5940
03:10:10.210 --> 03:10:11.960
Well, it's not really about money.
It was a small procedure, I can work.

5941
03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:12.860
-You can't sit down.
-I can.

5942
03:10:12.900 --> 03:10:13.970
-I drove here.
-Pretend that the chair is a car.

5943
03:10:15.720 --> 03:10:16.220
Yes.

5944
03:10:18.760 --> 03:10:19.830
-No one wanted to solve the case.
-What do you mean?

5945
03:10:19.870 --> 03:10:20.710
Monique Brammer
was reported missing.

5946
03:10:20.750 --> 03:10:22.240
Two prostitutes and a neighbour were
interviewed. The case was shelved.

5947
03:10:22.480 --> 03:10:23.140
It fell between two stools.

5948
03:10:23.180 --> 03:10:24.420
She disappeared, or she was killed.
They didn't find a body.

5949
03:10:24.840 --> 03:10:25.570
The case was
supposed to be shelved.

5950
03:10:25.610 --> 03:10:26.790
I'm surprised it took two weeks.
Come with me.

5951
03:10:30.090 --> 03:10:31.190
Do you think I should?
I tried painkillers, but...

5952
03:10:31.950 --> 03:10:32.760
-Two computers?
-They know who it is now.

5953
03:10:32.800 --> 03:10:33.560
-Will Saga handle the case, Hans?
-Yes.

5954
03:10:33.600 --> 03:10:34.490
-That's good.
-And a Danish police officer.

5955
03:10:34.530 --> 03:10:36.280
-Does he know that she's a bit odd?
-If not, he'll soon find out.

5956
03:10:37.700 --> 03:10:38.640
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

5957
03:10:38.680 --> 03:10:39.890
-This is Martin Röhde.
-It's Rohde.

5958
03:10:39.930 --> 03:10:41.190
Not as when you say "fur".
Rohde, Foure...

5959
03:10:42.060 --> 03:10:43.180
-Have you read the file?
-Most people have just arrived.

5960
03:10:43.220 --> 03:10:44.250
Half of two female bodies were found.
One was Kerstin Ekwall.

5961
03:10:44.290 --> 03:10:45.030
The other one has been deep-frozen.
Martin?

5962
03:10:45.070 --> 03:10:46.390
It's probably the 23-year-old
Monique Brammer from Copenhagen.

5963
03:10:46.430 --> 03:10:47.610
A prostitute and an addict
that went missing 13 months ago.

5964
03:10:48.260 --> 03:10:49.250
Do you want me to repeat that?
A bit slower?

5965
03:10:49.440 --> 03:10:50.400
Monique Brammer, 23 years old.
A prostitute and an addict.

5966
03:10:50.440 --> 03:10:51.300
She went missing 13 months ago.

5967
03:10:51.340 --> 03:10:52.870
-Right.
-The investigation was inadequate.

5968
03:10:53.690 --> 03:10:55.190
-Don't you agree?
-Yes. It was terrible.

5969
03:10:55.230 --> 03:10:56.300
But we found blood traces
in her apartment.

5970
03:10:56.340 --> 03:10:57.690
The samples are on their way
and can be compared to the body.

5971
03:10:57.730 --> 03:10:58.920
Before the bodies were dumped,
the power was cut for 48 seconds.

5972
03:10:58.960 --> 03:10:59.940
Their trying to trace the signal.
Can you help them, Gry?

5973
03:10:59.980 --> 03:11:00.960
-How was it done?
-Someone accessed a computer.

5974
03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:01.440
Can you show me the fourth picture?

5975
03:11:01.870 --> 03:11:02.480
Use all the people you need. Gry?

5976
03:11:02.520 --> 03:11:03.860
Here's Ekwall's mobile number.
Get the phone records.

5977
03:11:03.900 --> 03:11:05.000
Check her computers.
Talk to John about passwords.

5978
03:11:05.040 --> 03:11:05.910
Anne?
Find out where she was abducted.

5979
03:11:05.950 --> 03:11:07.140
She left work half past six.
She had a car. Find it!

5980
03:11:07.180 --> 03:11:08.580
-Were they dumped from her car?
-No, a black Cadillac Escalade.

5981
03:11:08.620 --> 03:11:10.040
The image where the bridge
is seen from above.

5982
03:11:10.080 --> 03:11:11.400
-John can find the license number.
-What? Sure.

5983
03:11:11.440 --> 03:11:12.390
-What are you doing?
-I had an idea.

5984
03:11:12.430 --> 03:11:13.920
The orange line the body was on...
We discussed where she was.

5985
03:11:13.960 --> 03:11:14.770
Here's the Swedish-Danish border.

5986
03:11:14.810 --> 03:11:15.870
One half is in Sweden,
one is in Denmark.

5987
03:11:15.910 --> 03:11:16.980
-It's millimetre perfect.
-Tell me everything about the line.

5988
03:11:17.020 --> 03:11:17.610
Take paint samples.

5989
03:11:17.650 --> 03:11:19.180
Power cut, body halves, a politician.
We'll be in the public eye.

5990
03:11:27.700 --> 03:11:29.190
-Hi. Is Veronika at home?
-Yes.

5991
03:11:29.230 --> 03:11:30.080
-What do you want?
-I would like to talk to her.

5992
03:11:30.120 --> 03:11:31.320
-You can talk to me.
-I would if you were clean.

5993
03:11:31.790 --> 03:11:32.500
-What? I am clean.
-Hi, Veronika.

5994
03:11:32.540 --> 03:11:33.980
-Isn't it enough to have us evicted?
-The landlord did that.

5995
03:11:34.410 --> 03:11:35.890
-You're not helping.
-I'm trying. I'm trying really hard.

5996
03:11:35.930 --> 03:11:37.390
If you had been more dependable,
you wouldn't have to move.

5997
03:11:38.370 --> 03:11:39.820
-That was bloody stupid.
-Sören! Stop it!

5998
03:11:41.920 --> 03:11:42.420
What the hell?

5999
03:11:43.970 --> 03:11:44.700
Stop, you bastard!

6000
03:11:46.620 --> 03:11:47.210
Stop! Come out!

6001
03:11:50.030 --> 03:11:50.870
Sören! Stop it, Sören! Stop it!

6002
03:11:50.910 --> 03:11:51.790
-I hate that bloody bastard!
-Sören!

6003
03:11:52.230 --> 03:11:53.530
He's caused trouble all along.
It makes me so angry!

6004
03:11:53.570 --> 03:11:55.040
Let go of me.
Go to hell, you bloody idiots.

6005
03:12:04.790 --> 03:12:05.600
-How's the operation going?
-It hasn't started.

6006
03:12:05.640 --> 03:12:06.730
-Why? He was prepared hours ago.
-I don't know.

6007
03:12:06.770 --> 03:12:07.460
I'm afraid I have to go.

6008
03:12:07.500 --> 03:12:08.990
-Don't you know where he is?
-You probably know better than me.

6009
03:12:09.030 --> 03:12:10.430
We'll call you if we hear from him...
Let's go.

6010
03:12:10.940 --> 03:12:12.160
-I'm sorry about all of this.
-Stop apologizing for him.

6011
03:12:12.890 --> 03:12:14.060
He's an adult
and makes his own decisions.

6012
03:12:14.100 --> 03:12:15.690
Maybe you should do the same?
Sören put you in this position.

6013
03:12:15.970 --> 03:12:17.270
You spend your money wisely,
but can't if you're not given any.

6014
03:12:17.760 --> 03:12:18.680
You don't get the chance
to care for your boys.

6015
03:12:19.200 --> 03:12:20.250
-He hits you and the children.
-Hardly ever the children.

6016
03:12:20.290 --> 03:12:21.280
Hardly ever? That's not good enough.

6017
03:12:21.640 --> 03:12:22.370
He shouldn't hit any of you.

6018
03:12:22.680 --> 03:12:24.320
You can get your life back on track.
Just you and the children.

6019
03:12:25.490 --> 03:12:26.360
Leave your husband
or nothing will change.

6020
03:12:27.130 --> 03:12:27.690
Think about it.

6021
03:12:30.720 --> 03:12:32.380
-Anders? What's going on?
-We've got a problem.

6022
03:12:32.420 --> 03:12:33.850
The donor was declared brain dead,
and a nurse spoke to his father.

6023
03:12:33.890 --> 03:12:35.210
The father changed his mind.
We can't have the heart. Göran!

6024
03:12:41.480 --> 03:12:42.110
Wasn't that the turn-off?

6025
03:12:42.680 --> 03:12:43.820
-Stefan? Wasn't that the turn-off?
-No, not today.

6026
03:12:44.440 --> 03:12:45.470
-Where are we going?
-You'll see.

6027
03:12:52.740 --> 03:12:54.340
Johan was nicknamed "The old bag".
He died a month ago.

6028
03:12:54.610 --> 03:12:56.210
No wife, no children, no debts,
no assets. The house was all he had.

6029
03:12:56.510 --> 03:12:57.220
It went to the local council.

6030
03:12:59.970 --> 03:13:00.470
It's Sören.

6031
03:13:01.900 --> 03:13:02.400
Come.

6032
03:13:10.450 --> 03:13:11.580
-Step inside.
-What about the children?

6033
03:13:11.620 --> 03:13:12.300
They can stay outside a while longer.

6034
03:13:13.740 --> 03:13:15.190
-Where are we? Why are we here?
-Just go inside.

6035
03:13:18.100 --> 03:13:19.550
-Crime scene and meeting place.
-Have you worked here a long time?

6036
03:13:19.590 --> 03:13:20.140
-More than ten years?
-Yes.

6037
03:13:20.180 --> 03:13:21.260
-Are you from around here?
-From Malmö? No.

6038
03:13:21.300 --> 03:13:23.020
I'm from Copenhagen.
I was born there.

6039
03:13:23.610 --> 03:13:25.500
No wonder Ingmar Bergman
and Lars Norén are from Sweden.

6040
03:13:25.710 --> 03:13:26.770
-Are you related to Lars Norén?
-No.

6041
03:13:27.110 --> 03:13:28.010
We need to find the meeting place
and the crime scene.

6042
03:13:28.050 --> 03:13:29.230
Where did the perpetrator
meet the victim?

6043
03:13:32.660 --> 03:13:33.890
I've spoken to Copenhagen.
You'll cooperate on the deaths.

6044
03:13:34.100 --> 03:13:34.930
Here's info about your authority.

6045
03:13:34.970 --> 03:13:36.130
I know what applies to me
in Denmark.

6046
03:13:36.770 --> 03:13:37.520
-Can I have a word with you, Saga?
-Yes.

6047
03:13:38.990 --> 03:13:39.910
The report you filed
against Martin...

6048
03:13:39.950 --> 03:13:40.580
Yes, there's only one.

6049
03:13:40.620 --> 03:13:41.590
What do you suggest I do with it?

6050
03:13:41.630 --> 03:13:42.590
Don't you think
it will affect your cooperation?

6051
03:13:42.870 --> 03:13:43.700
-Do you think so?
-I think there's every chance.

6052
03:13:43.890 --> 03:13:45.000
-Will he dislike me?
-That might happen.

6053
03:13:45.040 --> 03:13:46.560
Because of my report?
It doesn't have to affect the case.

6054
03:13:46.600 --> 03:13:47.600
He let an ambulance through.
No life was in danger.

6055
03:13:47.640 --> 03:13:48.610
-I'm supposed to file a report.
-I'll handle the report.

6056
03:13:48.650 --> 03:13:50.270
-Yes, that's fine. Fine.
-I've got the car's license number.

6057
03:13:50.310 --> 03:13:51.120
It belongs to Daniel Farbé in Malmö.

6058
03:13:51.160 --> 03:13:52.030
-The journalist?
-Yes, he's a journalist.

6059
03:13:53.980 --> 03:13:55.260
-Do you know who he is?
-Yes. I read his column.

6060
03:13:55.990 --> 03:13:56.550
It's entertaining.

6061
03:14:10.050 --> 03:14:11.450
-You made me jump.
-I worked all night.

6062
03:14:11.490 --> 03:14:12.680
-I'm done for the week. Berlin next.
-You work all night.

6063
03:14:12.720 --> 03:14:13.580
Then you get down in Berlin.
How do you manage?

6064
03:14:13.620 --> 03:14:14.750
Get down?
How many children have you got?

6065
03:14:14.790 --> 03:14:15.670
Children that suck the life
out of you.

6066
03:14:15.710 --> 03:14:17.360
I haven't got children. No one says
"get down" any more. No one.

6067
03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:18.650
-Have fun.
-I will.

6068
03:14:18.690 --> 03:14:19.360
I downloaded
"Elephants in the Desert".

6069
03:14:19.840 --> 03:14:20.430
What do you want, Åke?

6070
03:14:20.470 --> 03:14:21.530
A hug, an award, an applause?
Would you like one?

6071
03:14:22.120 --> 03:14:23.270
-They're really cool. I like them.
-Yes, they were cool.

6072
03:14:23.310 --> 03:14:24.700
What?
Two weeks ago you really liked them.

6073
03:14:24.740 --> 03:14:25.290
And now you like them.

6074
03:14:25.830 --> 03:14:26.360
My daughter...

6075
03:14:27.510 --> 03:14:28.480
-She danced all afternoon.
-Sorry, I have to answer.

6076
03:14:29.020 --> 03:14:29.860
We'll have to continue this later.

6077
03:14:31.730 --> 03:14:32.580
You and the boys will disappear.

6078
03:14:32.620 --> 03:14:33.480
Your paperwork
and your debts are gone.

6079
03:14:34.060 --> 03:14:35.220
You can make a fresh start.
Do you understand?

6080
03:14:35.660 --> 03:14:37.410
You can make a fresh start.
There's cash and a mobile here.

6081
03:14:37.900 --> 03:14:39.090
But you can never see or talk to
your husband again.

6082
03:14:39.630 --> 03:14:40.690
He's their dad.
I have to let them see him.

6083
03:14:40.730 --> 03:14:41.770
Why? Why do they have to?

6084
03:14:42.440 --> 03:14:44.010
To get another beating?
To be scared and broke?

6085
03:14:44.050 --> 03:14:45.570
Let him spend everything on drugs?
He'll ruin everything for you again.

6086
03:14:45.930 --> 03:14:46.630
People like him ruin things.

6087
03:14:47.370 --> 03:14:48.300
You don't know me.
Why are you doing this?

6088
03:14:50.690 --> 03:14:51.360
Because I can.

6089
03:15:02.820 --> 03:15:03.320
Bloody hell.

6090
03:15:11.520 --> 03:15:12.390
-Here's my car.
-Do you think it's him?

6091
03:15:12.430 --> 03:15:13.650
He kept a body in a freezer
and killed a politician.

6092
03:15:13.690 --> 03:15:14.740
-He wouldn't use his own car.
-Nice car.

6093
03:15:14.780 --> 03:15:16.040
-Is the Swedish police paid well?
-No, the same as in Denmark.

6094
03:15:16.080 --> 03:15:17.470
Don't jump to conclusions
about my wages based on my car.

6095
03:15:17.510 --> 03:15:18.760
Maybe it was a gift?
Maybe I inherited it or had savings?

6096
03:15:18.800 --> 03:15:20.030
I hope your professional conclusions
are more valid.

6097
03:15:20.070 --> 03:15:21.320
Read this.
It's Daniel Ferbé's latest column.

6098
03:15:21.360 --> 03:15:22.610
-The one that's a good writer?
-No, I said he's entertaining.

6099
03:15:22.650 --> 03:15:23.280
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

6100
03:15:35.850 --> 03:15:37.010
Hello? What's going on?

6101
03:15:37.050 --> 03:15:38.360
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-A Cadillac has a bomb in it.

6102
03:15:38.400 --> 03:15:39.400
Is it a black Escalade?
It's tied to a double homicide.

6103
03:15:39.440 --> 03:15:40.930
-Is the guy trying to kill himself?
-I don't think he was involved.

6104
03:15:40.970 --> 03:15:42.260
No, you're not going
anywhere near the place.

6105
03:15:49.770 --> 03:15:50.780
Help! Help!

6106
03:15:50.970 --> 03:15:51.670
-Take it easy.
-Please help me!

6107
03:15:51.710 --> 03:15:52.830
-Help me! Get me out!
-Calm down.

6108
03:15:54.630 --> 03:15:55.370
-Help me!
-The windshield is wired in.

6109
03:15:55.410 --> 03:15:56.360
The side windows are
connected to the electrical system.

6110
03:15:56.400 --> 03:15:57.790
The glass seems OK,
but there are wires everywhere.

6111
03:15:59.760 --> 03:16:00.430
We've got his contact details.

6112
03:16:04.770 --> 03:16:05.720
-What's going on?
-My mobile!

6113
03:16:05.760 --> 03:16:06.960
-Yes?
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

6114
03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:08.370
I need to know whether you were
on the bridge last night.

6115
03:16:08.660 --> 03:16:09.470
-What?
-Were you on the Öresund Bridge?

6116
03:16:09.510 --> 03:16:10.580
I was working.
I was here all the time.

6117
03:16:10.950 --> 03:16:11.950
-How will you get me out?
-I don't know, that's not my job.

6118
03:16:11.990 --> 03:16:13.060
-Do you know Kerstin Ekwall?
-Who?

6119
03:16:13.100 --> 03:16:13.990
Daniel? Did you do anything
apart from turn the key?

6120
03:16:14.030 --> 03:16:15.370
No. Everything locked.
The countdown started.

6121
03:16:15.410 --> 03:16:16.200
-Hello?
-I'm talking to the bomb guy.

6122
03:16:16.240 --> 03:16:17.010
Chairman of the City Council
Kerstin Ekwall.

6123
03:16:17.050 --> 03:16:18.500
-Have you written about her?
-No, I don't know.

6124
03:16:18.540 --> 03:16:19.620
-Have you been tipped off about her?
-No! What is this?

6125
03:16:19.660 --> 03:16:20.320
Get me out! Please!

6126
03:16:20.360 --> 03:16:21.480
Does anyone else
have a key to your car?

6127
03:16:21.520 --> 03:16:22.920
-No, I don't know.
-Can you reach it?

6128
03:16:22.960 --> 03:16:23.840
I don't want to die. Please.

6129
03:16:23.880 --> 03:16:25.160
-I don't want it to end like this.
-Daniel? You need to talk to me.

6130
03:16:26.350 --> 03:16:27.740
It skipped a minute.
What the hell did you do?

6131
03:16:27.950 --> 03:16:29.530
It was three, now it's two.
It was three.

6132
03:16:30.020 --> 03:16:30.950
Come one, hurry up.

6133
03:16:30.990 --> 03:16:32.250
Where are you going?
Stay here! Please!

6134
03:16:32.850 --> 03:16:34.440
Please! Come back!
Where are you going?

6135
03:16:37.710 --> 03:16:39.090
You need to talk to me.
Daniel? Daniel?

6136
03:16:39.500 --> 03:16:40.060
Is it a big bomb?

6137
03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:42.160
-I think so.
-You're not religious, right?

6138
03:16:42.200 --> 03:16:42.870
You're an atheist?

6139
03:16:42.910 --> 03:16:44.430
Everything will just stop. The body
won't have time to register pain.

6140
03:16:45.540 --> 03:16:46.960
-Are you sure?
-Don't look at the clock. Listen.

6141
03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:48.400
Do you know why your car
was used to dump two bodies?

6142
03:16:49.080 --> 03:16:49.890
-No.
-Think about it. Focus.

6143
03:16:49.930 --> 03:16:51.310
-Who did this to you?
-I've slagged so many people off.

6144
03:16:54.470 --> 03:16:55.530
Daniel? Are you still there? Hello?

6145
03:17:02.380 --> 03:17:02.900
It's clean.

6146
03:17:04.800 --> 03:17:05.960
Sorry about the drama, it's hard
to make oneself heard today.

6147
03:17:06.000 --> 03:17:06.780
I assume I have your attention now.

6148
03:17:06.820 --> 03:17:08.420
Our part of the world would be
wonderful if we solved our problems.

6149
03:17:08.460 --> 03:17:09.290
I would like to
point out five in particular.

6150
03:17:09.330 --> 03:17:10.950
This is only a beginning. We've got
interesting times ahead of us.

6151
03:17:10.950 --> 03:17:11.850
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-Copenhagen Police.

6152
03:17:11.890 --> 03:17:12.580
-Do you know who she is?
-Yes.

6153
03:17:12.860 --> 03:17:14.540
Excuse me. A woman insists on
speaking to the person in charge.

6154
03:17:14.990 --> 03:17:16.080
-Is she in Sweden or Denmark?
-I don't know.

6155
03:17:16.350 --> 03:17:17.750
She's Swedish, and the car came
from Sweden. I assume I'm in charge.

6156
03:17:19.140 --> 03:17:20.280
-Saga Norén. Can I help you?
-When will you let traffic through?

6157
03:17:20.320 --> 03:17:21.380
-It might take up to two hours.
-I haven't got two hours!

6158
03:17:21.420 --> 03:17:22.180
-Back up.
-Is someone's life in danger?

6159
03:17:22.220 --> 03:17:22.990
There's a heart for my husband
in Copenhagen.

6160
03:17:23.030 --> 03:17:24.110
He needs a heart transplant.
Let us through.

6161
03:17:24.150 --> 03:17:25.100
He'll have to wait.
I can't let anyone through.

6162
03:17:25.470 --> 03:17:26.590
-What's happened?
-Is there no other way through?

6163
03:17:26.630 --> 03:17:27.630
There ought to be
another way through.

6164
03:17:27.670 --> 03:17:29.120
-No one's answering any questions.
-Let me pass, please.

6165
03:17:31.650 --> 03:17:32.960
The Öresund Bridge to Denmark
is closed.

6166
03:17:33.000 --> 03:17:33.880
According to the police it will...

6167
03:17:38.560 --> 03:17:39.800
-It's Stefan Lindberg.
-Hi, it's Veronika.

6168
03:17:39.840 --> 03:17:41.220
-Sorry, did I wake you up?
-No, you didn't. How are you?

6169
03:17:41.260 --> 03:17:42.450
I can't sleep.
I've got a stomach ache.

6170
03:17:42.490 --> 03:17:43.550
-I see. How are the boys?
-They're asleep.

6171
03:17:43.590 --> 03:17:44.630
They don't understand
what's about to happen.

6172
03:17:44.670 --> 03:17:45.950
-Can we meet up?
-Now?

6173
03:17:46.570 --> 03:17:47.420
Of course.
Do you want me to come over?

6174
03:17:47.850 --> 03:17:49.260
-No. I'd rather go to your place.
-OK.

6175
03:17:49.300 --> 03:17:50.240
-I can go to the office.
-I'll see you there.

6176
03:17:52.860 --> 03:17:53.890
Give me everything from
when the car came on to the bridge.

6177
03:17:53.930 --> 03:17:55.160
One camera records at a time.
They're started manually.

6178
03:17:55.200 --> 03:17:56.060
My colleague
might have recorded something.

6179
03:17:56.100 --> 03:17:57.130
Hello! Stop! Stop!

6180
03:17:57.170 --> 03:17:58.510
-Stop! Stop!
-I allowed it.

6181
03:17:58.550 --> 03:17:59.820
-Why? This is a crime scene.
-I'm fully aware of that.

6182
03:17:59.860 --> 03:18:00.610
-We've got enough bodies.
-He wasn't dying.

6183
03:18:00.650 --> 03:18:01.670
-Are you a doctor?
-No, I'm a police officer.

6184
03:18:02.260 --> 03:18:03.430
-What's your name?
-Martin Rohde.

6185
03:18:03.470 --> 03:18:04.370
-Rohde?
-R, O, H, D, E.

6186
03:18:04.410 --> 03:18:06.090
-Have you got an ID?
-It was an ambulance.

6187
03:18:06.130 --> 03:18:07.320
The Chairman
of Malmö City Council is dead.

6188
03:18:07.360 --> 03:18:08.660
-What evidence was destroyed?
-Probably none.

6189
03:18:08.700 --> 03:18:09.210
Thank you.

6190
03:18:15.650 --> 03:18:16.500
Hello. Hi. Finally.

6191
03:18:16.540 --> 03:18:17.950
I wont operate on Göran, Charlotte.
I had wine with my dinner.

6192
03:18:18.270 --> 03:18:19.840
-At what time? Are you drunk?
-No, but that doesn't matter.

6193
03:18:20.180 --> 03:18:21.160
You promised to see us through this.

6194
03:18:21.200 --> 03:18:22.280
-Morten Krag is a very good surgeon.
-Better than you?

6195
03:18:22.320 --> 03:18:23.190
I'll decide
who my husband's surgeon is!

6196
03:18:23.230 --> 03:18:24.700
-I wont forgive you if it goes wrong.
-What if I do it and it goes wrong?

6197
03:18:25.370 --> 03:18:26.260
Then I'll never forgive myself.

6198
03:18:30.160 --> 03:18:31.370
-We're done, you can move her.
-You can take her away.

6199
03:18:33.460 --> 03:18:33.990
Bloody hell.

6200
03:18:38.330 --> 03:18:39.480
The autopsy on Kerstin Ekwall
is being performed.

6201
03:18:39.520 --> 03:18:40.440
-And the recordings?
-They'll deliver them tomorrow.

6202
03:18:40.480 --> 03:18:41.240
-What about the press?
-They know.

6203
03:18:41.280 --> 03:18:42.340
The radio said that it was a woman.
They don't know who it is.

6204
03:18:42.380 --> 03:18:43.660
-And the family?
-I'm on my way to see them.

6205
03:18:43.700 --> 03:18:45.190
You'll wake them up, and there
are children there. Tread lightly.

6206
03:18:45.230 --> 03:18:46.780
In what sense? Oh. There aren't
that many ways to say it.

6207
03:18:46.820 --> 03:18:47.580
-Just tread lightly.
-Listen, Hans...

6208
03:18:47.620 --> 03:18:48.320
She was chopped in half.

6209
03:18:48.360 --> 03:18:49.430
-Right above the hips.
-What the hell are you saying?

6210
03:18:50.050 --> 03:18:51.510
She was due to attend a conference
in Copenhagen this morning.

6211
03:18:51.810 --> 03:18:52.870
-Have you got more computers?
-No.

6212
03:18:52.910 --> 03:18:53.800
Are you taking them?
The children's as well?

6213
03:18:53.840 --> 03:18:54.980
-When did you last talk to her?
-She called yesterday.

6214
03:18:55.200 --> 03:18:56.030
-Do you know what time it was?
-I don't know.

6215
03:18:56.260 --> 03:18:57.100
Around half past six in the evening.

6216
03:18:57.140 --> 03:18:57.940
-Was she threatened?
-By whom?

6217
03:18:57.980 --> 03:18:58.750
I didn't say that she was,
I asked you.

6218
03:18:59.030 --> 03:19:00.690
Not really. She was a politician,
there were some calls and emails.

6219
03:19:00.730 --> 03:19:02.180
-Has she upset anyone lately?
-Lately...

6220
03:19:02.420 --> 03:19:03.420
She wanted to charge for
library loans. Some disapproved.

6221
03:19:03.670 --> 03:19:04.440
-That's foolish.
-Sorry, what?

6222
03:19:04.480 --> 03:19:06.080
Reading becomes a money matter.
Social differences will grow.

6223
03:19:06.120 --> 03:19:07.040
-Is that why she was...?
-We don't know why.

6224
03:19:07.080 --> 03:19:07.820
It's unlikely
that library fees caused it.

6225
03:19:08.190 --> 03:19:09.070
Why? Why did someone do this?

6226
03:19:09.110 --> 03:19:10.760
Can you think of something personal?
Was she in debt? Did she use drugs?

6227
03:19:10.800 --> 03:19:11.530
Did she have an affair?

6228
03:19:15.350 --> 03:19:15.940
Saga Norén.

6229
03:19:16.410 --> 03:19:17.010
Can't we talk on the phone?

6230
03:19:17.550 --> 03:19:18.480
I'll be there in twenty minutes. Bye.

6231
03:19:29.900 --> 03:19:30.400
August?

6232
03:19:43.450 --> 03:19:44.240
-Were you on the bridge?
-Yes.

6233
03:19:44.280 --> 03:19:45.300
-What happened?
-A murder, the Swedes will handle it.

6234
03:19:45.570 --> 03:19:46.150
-Did you check on August?
-Yes.

6235
03:19:46.190 --> 03:19:47.070
-Is he asleep?
-Yes.

6236
03:19:47.110 --> 03:19:48.180
You promised to talk to him.
He's become a night owl.

6237
03:19:48.220 --> 03:19:48.990
Do you want me to
wake him up now?

6238
03:19:49.280 --> 03:19:50.620
-He got up at three o'clock today.
-I'll have a word with him tomorrow.

6239
03:19:53.610 --> 03:19:54.740
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

6240
03:20:00.510 --> 03:20:01.980
-Do you know the cause of death?
-I can make a qualified guess.

6241
03:20:02.020 --> 03:20:02.960
She died six to eight hours ago.

6242
03:20:03.000 --> 03:20:04.250
Yes, she called home at six thirty
and was dumped just after midnight.

6243
03:20:04.660 --> 03:20:05.470
There's something else.

6244
03:20:05.510 --> 03:20:06.150
-What?
-Take a look.

6245
03:20:13.330 --> 03:20:14.930
No livor mortis on the ears.
That's consistent with the bleeding.

6246
03:20:14.970 --> 03:20:15.680
Petechiae on the conjunctivas.

6247
03:20:16.460 --> 03:20:17.060
The face is swollen.

6248
03:20:18.150 --> 03:20:19.140
She was strangled
and cut in half after death.

6249
03:20:19.380 --> 03:20:19.940
And the other half?

6250
03:20:21.370 --> 03:20:22.560
The lower body is much paler.
A lot paler.

6251
03:20:23.220 --> 03:20:24.420
It's not coherent with the bleeding
or how the body was placed.

6252
03:20:25.540 --> 03:20:26.640
There's brown discoloration.
Frostbite?

6253
03:20:26.910 --> 03:20:28.060
It feels different. Frostbite.

6254
03:20:28.100 --> 03:20:28.820
Not frostbite, deep-freezing.

6255
03:20:28.860 --> 03:20:30.050
For about a year, I think.
I've never seen anything like this.

6256
03:20:30.090 --> 03:20:31.340
I don't know who they belong to.
They're not Kerstin Ekwall's legs.

6257
03:20:37.040 --> 03:20:37.920
-So everyone's here, then.
-Yes.

6258
03:20:37.960 --> 03:20:38.460
Hi, Sebastian.

6259
03:20:39.700 --> 03:20:40.280
I don't know what to do.

6260
03:20:40.320 --> 03:20:41.360
I'm worried about tomorrow.
I had to see you.

6261
03:20:41.400 --> 03:20:42.170
Can't you just pay the rent?

6262
03:20:42.210 --> 03:20:43.650
They can't evict the children.
Can they? Their friends are there.

6263
03:20:43.690 --> 03:20:44.490
I paid out money for the rent.

6264
03:20:45.070 --> 03:20:46.040
-Why did you bring the children?
-Sören wasn't there.

6265
03:20:46.460 --> 03:20:47.050
I can't manage.

6266
03:20:47.250 --> 03:20:48.460
-Can't you make an exception?
-No. You know I can't.

6267
03:20:48.500 --> 03:20:49.470
-Please.
-There are guidelines. I'm sorry.

6268
03:20:53.640 --> 03:20:54.920
Charlotte Söringer? I'm Frederik
Henriksen, hospital administrator.

6269
03:20:55.500 --> 03:20:56.800
-Göran had atrial fibrillation.
-They managed to stop it.

6270
03:20:56.840 --> 03:20:57.880
-He's to weak for surgery.
-Too weak?

6271
03:20:57.920 --> 03:20:59.100
-But there's a new heart.
-It will be given to someone else.

6272
03:20:59.470 --> 03:21:00.440
Anders said
that you need a new CT scanner.

6273
03:21:00.480 --> 03:21:02.060
My husband's business is doing well.
He's willing to donate a CT scanner.

6274
03:21:02.100 --> 03:21:02.870
We're cancelling for his own sake.

6275
03:21:02.910 --> 03:21:04.230
He'll die without a new heart.
I want both parties to benefit.

6276
03:21:04.270 --> 03:21:05.910
Pass my offer on
to the proper authority, please.

6277
03:21:11.550 --> 03:21:12.250
-Hello? Is this Martin Rohde?
-Yes.

6278
03:21:12.290 --> 03:21:13.420
-It's Saga Norén from the bridge.
-Yes, I remember.

6279
03:21:13.460 --> 03:21:15.110
-Were you asleep?
-I tend to doze off around this time.

6280
03:21:15.150 --> 03:21:16.000
-There were two women.
-You found another one.

6281
03:21:16.040 --> 03:21:16.970
The lower body
belonged to someone else.

6282
03:21:17.010 --> 03:21:18.270
-Have you found half a body?
-I don't know.

6283
03:21:18.310 --> 03:21:19.800
It could be more than a year ago.
The legs have been deep-frozen.

6284
03:21:19.840 --> 03:21:21.000
-Can you look into it? Now?
-First thing tomorrow morning.

6285
03:21:21.270 --> 03:21:22.220
Can someone else
look into it straight away?

6286
03:21:23.020 --> 03:21:23.950
-I'll call you back.
-When?

6287
03:21:25.840 --> 03:21:26.480
-Do you have to get up?
-Yes.

6288
03:21:33.410 --> 03:21:34.480
Missing woman, Caucasian,
at least a year ago...

6289
03:21:34.520 --> 03:21:35.180
-How old?
-Adult.

6290
03:21:35.430 --> 03:21:36.220
-And life in general is OK?
-Yes.

6291
03:21:36.260 --> 03:21:36.940
-What about you?
-I'm fine.

6292
03:21:37.420 --> 03:21:38.760
-So you'll be firing blanks.
-Was it in the staff news bulletin?

6293
03:21:38.800 --> 03:21:40.200
-Is everything working as it should?
-It will in time.

6294
03:21:40.240 --> 03:21:40.880
It can't be much fun.

6295
03:21:40.920 --> 03:21:42.110
-What do you mean?
-You've heard about castrated toms?

6296
03:21:42.410 --> 03:21:43.810
A wild predator turns into
a chunky sleepyhead. Just like that.

6297
03:21:44.400 --> 03:21:45.700
They're castrated,
that's not the same thing.

6298
03:21:46.180 --> 03:21:46.870
Let's see what we've got.

6299
03:21:47.550 --> 03:21:48.170
Two women killed a year apart.

6300
03:21:48.210 --> 03:21:49.420
One was deep-frozen.
They were dismembered.

6301
03:21:49.460 --> 03:21:51.080
And assembled on the bridge.
Someone wants to make a statement.

6302
03:21:53.210 --> 03:21:53.850
-Saga Norén.
-It's Martin.

6303
03:21:53.890 --> 03:21:55.350
The lower body is Monique Brammer,
I think. A missing 23-year-old.

6304
03:21:55.390 --> 03:21:56.160
-Can you email the info?
-I'll be right over.

6305
03:21:56.200 --> 03:21:57.180
-Why do you want to come here?
-She's Danish.

6306
03:21:57.220 --> 03:21:58.390
I was first on the scene.
Everyone's still asleep here.

6307
03:21:58.430 --> 03:21:59.260
-Do you mind if I come over?
-Yes.

6308
03:21:59.300 --> 03:22:00.420
Make sure I'm allowed in.
You've got my details.

6309
03:22:00.820 --> 03:22:02.300
Martin Rohde has probably identified
the second body. He's coming over.

6310
03:22:02.340 --> 03:22:03.470
-Is that a problem?
-Yes...

6311
03:22:03.820 --> 03:22:04.340
No, no.

6312
03:22:04.380 --> 03:22:05.830
If half of the body is Danish,
we have to cooperate.

6313
03:22:05.870 --> 03:22:06.600
I'll schedule a meeting
at half past five.

6314
03:22:06.640 --> 03:22:07.600
-Can you be ready by then?
-Yes.

6315
03:22:14.610 --> 03:22:15.180
It finally worked out.

6316
03:22:17.100 --> 03:22:18.670
-What did you just sign?
-Formalities.

6317
03:22:19.270 --> 03:22:20.330
-Whose is it?
-What?

6318
03:22:20.370 --> 03:22:20.960
The heart. Whose is it?

6319
03:22:21.000 --> 03:22:22.050
A man's. He's 25 or 26
and had a motorcycle accident.

6320
03:22:22.930 --> 03:22:24.270
-What's his name?
-I don't know. Does it matter?

6321
03:22:24.960 --> 03:22:25.940
No, I guess it doesn't.

6322
03:22:26.900 --> 03:22:28.250
-I'm scared.
-It will be fine.

6323
03:22:28.670 --> 03:22:30.030
Anders will operate, they're all
highly skilled. It will be fine.

6324
03:22:30.310 --> 03:22:30.960
I can't imagine life without you.

6325
03:22:31.780 --> 03:22:33.460
-I need to take Göran with me.
-Don't worry. You'll make it, honey.

6326
03:22:34.610 --> 03:22:35.220
-Hi.
-Hi.

6327
03:22:35.260 --> 03:22:36.060
-Hi! An early breakfast?
-No thank you.

6328
03:22:36.100 --> 03:22:37.470
-An email would have been faster.
-Yes, but not as pleasant.

6329
03:22:38.140 --> 03:22:39.230
-Where are you going?
-I'm coming in with you.

6330
03:22:39.650 --> 03:22:41.460
If it really is Monique Brammer,
we both have responsibilities.

6331
03:22:42.260 --> 03:22:43.180
Go straight on,
turn left, and register.

6332
03:22:45.850 --> 03:22:47.430
-Good morning. Coffee?
-No thanks, I've already had some.

6333
03:22:47.470 --> 03:22:48.800
I'm Martin Rohde.
I'll be working with Saga.

6334
03:22:48.840 --> 03:22:50.370
-Thank you. You need to register.
-I also need a card.

6335
03:22:50.410 --> 03:22:51.160
-My name's Felicia.
-Nice to meet you.

6336
03:22:51.620 --> 03:22:52.520
-That's it. This is for you.
-Thank you.

6337
03:22:52.560 --> 03:22:53.820
-And one of these is for you.
-Thanks! Ooh, Danish.

6338
03:22:54.840 --> 03:22:55.480
-See you later.
-I hope so.

6339
03:22:57.850 --> 03:22:59.340
-Where's Saga Norén?
-To the right. Bye!

6340
03:23:02.600 --> 03:23:03.220
Excuse me.

6341
03:23:03.260 --> 03:23:04.070
-Sit down.
-I'm afraid I can't.

6342
03:23:05.300 --> 03:23:06.590
-You make me nervous.
-OK, I can stand still.

6343
03:23:06.630 --> 03:23:07.910
-Why can't you sit down?
-My nether regions hurt.

6344
03:23:08.360 --> 03:23:09.710
-I had a vasectomy yesterday.
-Right.

6345
03:23:09.750 --> 03:23:10.580
I've got five children
with three different women.

6346
03:23:10.930 --> 03:23:11.930
-Have you got children?
-No, why would I want to?

6347
03:23:11.970 --> 03:23:13.040
-I've never heard anyone ask that.
-Many should have.

6348
03:23:14.210 --> 03:23:15.220
Not you,
I'm sure you're a wonderful dad.

6349
03:23:17.600 --> 03:23:18.900
-Why aren't you off sick?
-I can't afford it. August moved in.

6350
03:23:18.940 --> 03:23:20.690
Well, it's not really about money.
It was a small procedure, I can work.

6351
03:23:20.730 --> 03:23:21.590
-You can't sit down.
-I can.

6352
03:23:21.630 --> 03:23:22.700
-I drove here.
-Pretend that the chair is a car.

6353
03:23:24.450 --> 03:23:24.950
Yes.

6354
03:23:27.490 --> 03:23:28.560
-No one wanted to solve the case.
-What do you mean?

6355
03:23:28.600 --> 03:23:29.440
Monique Brammer
was reported missing.

6356
03:23:29.480 --> 03:23:30.970
Two prostitutes and a neighbour were
interviewed. The case was shelved.

6357
03:23:31.210 --> 03:23:31.870
It fell between two stools.

6358
03:23:31.910 --> 03:23:33.150
She disappeared, or she was killed.
They didn't find a body.

6359
03:23:33.570 --> 03:23:34.300
The case was
supposed to be shelved.

6360
03:23:34.340 --> 03:23:35.520
I'm surprised it took two weeks.
Come with me.

6361
03:23:38.820 --> 03:23:39.920
Do you think I should?
I tried painkillers, but...

6362
03:23:40.680 --> 03:23:41.490
-Two computers?
-They know who it is now.

6363
03:23:41.530 --> 03:23:42.290
-Will Saga handle the case, Hans?
-Yes.

6364
03:23:42.330 --> 03:23:43.220
-That's good.
-And a Danish police officer.

6365
03:23:43.260 --> 03:23:45.010
-Does he know that she's a bit odd?
-If not, he'll soon find out.

6366
03:23:46.430 --> 03:23:47.370
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

6367
03:23:47.410 --> 03:23:48.620
-This is Martin Röhde.
-It's Rohde.

6368
03:23:48.660 --> 03:23:49.920
Not as when you say "fur".
Rohde, Foure...

6369
03:23:50.790 --> 03:23:51.910
-Have you read the file?
-Most people have just arrived.

6370
03:23:51.950 --> 03:23:52.980
Half of two female bodies were found.
One was Kerstin Ekwall.

6371
03:23:53.020 --> 03:23:53.760
The other one has been deep-frozen.
Martin?

6372
03:23:53.800 --> 03:23:55.120
It's probably the 23-year-old
Monique Brammer from Copenhagen.

6373
03:23:55.160 --> 03:23:56.340
A prostitute and an addict
that went missing 13 months ago.

6374
03:23:56.990 --> 03:23:57.980
Do you want me to repeat that?
A bit slower?

6375
03:23:58.170 --> 03:23:59.130
Monique Brammer, 23 years old.
A prostitute and an addict.

6376
03:23:59.170 --> 03:24:00.030
She went missing 13 months ago.

6377
03:24:00.070 --> 03:24:01.600
-Right.
-The investigation was inadequate.

6378
03:24:02.420 --> 03:24:03.920
-Don't you agree?
-Yes. It was terrible.

6379
03:24:03.960 --> 03:24:05.030
But we found blood traces
in her apartment.

6380
03:24:05.070 --> 03:24:06.420
The samples are on their way
and can be compared to the body.

6381
03:24:06.460 --> 03:24:07.650
Before the bodies were dumped,
the power was cut for 48 seconds.

6382
03:24:07.690 --> 03:24:08.670
Their trying to trace the signal.
Can you help them, Gry?

6383
03:24:08.710 --> 03:24:09.690
-How was it done?
-Someone accessed a computer.

6384
03:24:09.730 --> 03:24:10.170
Can you show me the fourth picture?

6385
03:24:10.600 --> 03:24:11.210
Use all the people you need. Gry?

6386
03:24:11.250 --> 03:24:12.590
Here's Ekwall's mobile number.
Get the phone records.

6387
03:24:12.630 --> 03:24:13.730
Check her computers.
Talk to John about passwords.

6388
03:24:13.770 --> 03:24:14.640
Anne?
Find out where she was abducted.

6389
03:24:14.680 --> 03:24:15.870
She left work half past six.
She had a car. Find it!

6390
03:24:15.910 --> 03:24:17.310
-Were they dumped from her car?
-No, a black Cadillac Escalade.

6391
03:24:17.350 --> 03:24:18.770
The image where the bridge
is seen from above.

6392
03:24:18.810 --> 03:24:20.130
-John can find the license number.
-What? Sure.

6393
03:24:20.170 --> 03:24:21.120
-What are you doing?
-I had an idea.

6394
03:24:21.160 --> 03:24:22.650
The orange line the body was on...
We discussed where she was.

6395
03:24:22.690 --> 03:24:23.500
Here's the Swedish-Danish border.

6396
03:24:23.540 --> 03:24:24.600
One half is in Sweden,
one is in Denmark.

6397
03:24:24.640 --> 03:24:25.710
-It's millimetre perfect.
-Tell me everything about the line.

6398
03:24:25.750 --> 03:24:26.340
Take paint samples.

6399
03:24:26.380 --> 03:24:27.910
Power cut, body halves, a politician.
We'll be in the public eye.

6400
03:24:36.430 --> 03:24:37.920
-Hi. Is Veronika at home?
-Yes.

6401
03:24:37.960 --> 03:24:38.810
-What do you want?
-I would like to talk to her.

6402
03:24:38.850 --> 03:24:40.050
-You can talk to me.
-I would if you were clean.

6403
03:24:40.520 --> 03:24:41.230
-What? I am clean.
-Hi, Veronika.

6404
03:24:41.270 --> 03:24:42.710
-Isn't it enough to have us evicted?
-The landlord did that.

6405
03:24:43.140 --> 03:24:44.620
-You're not helping.
-I'm trying. I'm trying really hard.

6406
03:24:44.660 --> 03:24:46.120
If you had been more dependable,
you wouldn't have to move.

6407
03:24:47.100 --> 03:24:48.550
-That was bloody stupid.
-Sören! Stop it!

6408
03:24:50.650 --> 03:24:51.150
What the hell?

6409
03:24:52.700 --> 03:24:53.430
Stop, you bastard!

6410
03:24:55.350 --> 03:24:55.940
Stop! Come out!

6411
03:24:58.760 --> 03:24:59.600
Sören! Stop it, Sören! Stop it!

6412
03:24:59.640 --> 03:25:00.520
-I hate that bloody bastard!
-Sören!

6413
03:25:00.960 --> 03:25:02.260
He's caused trouble all along.
It makes me so angry!

6414
03:25:02.300 --> 03:25:03.770
Let go of me.
Go to hell, you bloody idiots.

6415
03:25:13.520 --> 03:25:14.330
-How's the operation going?
-It hasn't started.

6416
03:25:14.370 --> 03:25:15.460
-Why? He was prepared hours ago.
-I don't know.

6417
03:25:15.500 --> 03:25:16.190
I'm afraid I have to go.

6418
03:25:16.230 --> 03:25:17.720
-Don't you know where he is?
-You probably know better than me.

6419
03:25:17.760 --> 03:25:19.160
We'll call you if we hear from him...
Let's go.

6420
03:25:19.670 --> 03:25:20.890
-I'm sorry about all of this.
-Stop apologizing for him.

6421
03:25:21.620 --> 03:25:22.790
He's an adult
and makes his own decisions.

6422
03:25:22.830 --> 03:25:24.420
Maybe you should do the same?
Sören put you in this position.

6423
03:25:24.700 --> 03:25:26.000
You spend your money wisely,
but can't if you're not given any.

6424
03:25:26.490 --> 03:25:27.410
You don't get the chance
to care for your boys.

6425
03:25:27.930 --> 03:25:28.980
-He hits you and the children.
-Hardly ever the children.

6426
03:25:29.020 --> 03:25:30.010
Hardly ever? That's not good enough.

6427
03:25:30.370 --> 03:25:31.100
He shouldn't hit any of you.

6428
03:25:31.410 --> 03:25:33.050
You can get your life back on track.
Just you and the children.

6429
03:25:34.220 --> 03:25:35.090
Leave your husband
or nothing will change.

6430
03:25:35.860 --> 03:25:36.420
Think about it.

6431
03:25:39.450 --> 03:25:41.110
-Anders? What's going on?
-We've got a problem.

6432
03:25:41.150 --> 03:25:42.580
The donor was declared brain dead,
and a nurse spoke to his father.

6433
03:25:42.620 --> 03:25:43.940
The father changed his mind.
We can't have the heart. Göran!

6434
03:25:50.210 --> 03:25:50.840
Wasn't that the turn-off?

6435
03:25:51.410 --> 03:25:52.550
-Stefan? Wasn't that the turn-off?
-No, not today.

6436
03:25:53.170 --> 03:25:54.200
-Where are we going?
-You'll see.

6437
03:26:01.470 --> 03:26:03.070
Johan was nicknamed "The old bag".
He died a month ago.

6438
03:26:03.340 --> 03:26:04.940
No wife, no children, no debts,
no assets. The house was all he had.

6439
03:26:05.240 --> 03:26:05.950
It went to the local council.

6440
03:26:08.700 --> 03:26:09.200
It's Sören.

6441
03:26:10.630 --> 03:26:11.130
Come.

6442
03:26:19.180 --> 03:26:20.310
-Step inside.
-What about the children?

6443
03:26:20.350 --> 03:26:21.030
They can stay outside a while longer.

6444
03:26:22.470 --> 03:26:23.920
-Where are we? Why are we here?
-Just go inside.

6445
03:26:26.830 --> 03:26:28.280
-Crime scene and meeting place.
-Have you worked here a long time?

6446
03:26:28.320 --> 03:26:28.870
-More than ten years?
-Yes.

6447
03:26:28.910 --> 03:26:29.990
-Are you from around here?
-From Malmö? No.

6448
03:26:30.030 --> 03:26:31.750
I'm from Copenhagen.
I was born there.

6449
03:26:32.340 --> 03:26:34.230
No wonder Ingmar Bergman
and Lars Norén are from Sweden.

6450
03:26:34.440 --> 03:26:35.500
-Are you related to Lars Norén?
-No.

6451
03:26:35.840 --> 03:26:36.740
We need to find the meeting place
and the crime scene.

6452
03:26:36.780 --> 03:26:37.960
Where did the perpetrator
meet the victim?

6453
03:26:41.390 --> 03:26:42.620
I've spoken to Copenhagen.
You'll cooperate on the deaths.

6454
03:26:42.830 --> 03:26:43.660
Here's info about your authority.

6455
03:26:43.700 --> 03:26:44.860
I know what applies to me
in Denmark.

6456
03:26:45.500 --> 03:26:46.250
-Can I have a word with you, Saga?
-Yes.

6457
03:26:47.720 --> 03:26:48.640
The report you filed
against Martin...

6458
03:26:48.680 --> 03:26:49.310
Yes, there's only one.

6459
03:26:49.350 --> 03:26:50.320
What do you suggest I do with it?

6460
03:26:50.360 --> 03:26:51.320
Don't you think
it will affect your cooperation?

6461
03:26:51.600 --> 03:26:52.430
-Do you think so?
-I think there's every chance.

6462
03:26:52.620 --> 03:26:53.730
-Will he dislike me?
-That might happen.

6463
03:26:53.770 --> 03:26:55.290
Because of my report?
It doesn't have to affect the case.

6464
03:26:55.330 --> 03:26:56.330
He let an ambulance through.
No life was in danger.

6465
03:26:56.370 --> 03:26:57.340
-I'm supposed to file a report.
-I'll handle the report.

6466
03:26:57.380 --> 03:26:59.000
-Yes, that's fine. Fine.
-I've got the car's license number.

6467
03:26:59.040 --> 03:26:59.850
It belongs to Daniel Farbé in Malmö.

6468
03:26:59.890 --> 03:27:00.760
-The journalist?
-Yes, he's a journalist.

6469
03:27:02.710 --> 03:27:03.990
-Do you know who he is?
-Yes. I read his column.

6470
03:27:04.720 --> 03:27:05.280
It's entertaining.

6471
03:27:18.780 --> 03:27:20.180
-You made me jump.
-I worked all night.

6472
03:27:20.220 --> 03:27:21.410
-I'm done for the week. Berlin next.
-You work all night.

6473
03:27:21.450 --> 03:27:22.310
Then you get down in Berlin.
How do you manage?

6474
03:27:22.350 --> 03:27:23.480
Get down?
How many children have you got?

6475
03:27:23.520 --> 03:27:24.400
Children that suck the life
out of you.

6476
03:27:24.440 --> 03:27:26.090
I haven't got children. No one says
"get down" any more. No one.

6477
03:27:26.730 --> 03:27:27.380
-Have fun.
-I will.

6478
03:27:27.420 --> 03:27:28.090
I downloaded
"Elephants in the Desert".

6479
03:27:28.570 --> 03:27:29.160
What do you want, Åke?

6480
03:27:29.200 --> 03:27:30.260
A hug, an award, an applause?
Would you like one?

6481
03:27:30.850 --> 03:27:32.000
-They're really cool. I like them.
-Yes, they were cool.

6482
03:27:32.040 --> 03:27:33.430
What?
Two weeks ago you really liked them.

6483
03:27:33.470 --> 03:27:34.020
And now you like them.

6484
03:27:34.560 --> 03:27:35.090
My daughter...

6485
03:27:36.240 --> 03:27:37.210
-She danced all afternoon.
-Sorry, I have to answer.

6486
03:27:37.750 --> 03:27:38.590
We'll have to continue this later.

6487
03:27:40.460 --> 03:27:41.310
You and the boys will disappear.

6488
03:27:41.350 --> 03:27:42.210
Your paperwork
and your debts are gone.

6489
03:27:42.790 --> 03:27:43.950
You can make a fresh start.
Do you understand?

6490
03:27:44.390 --> 03:27:46.140
You can make a fresh start.
There's cash and a mobile here.

6491
03:27:46.630 --> 03:27:47.820
But you can never see or talk to
your husband again.

6492
03:27:48.360 --> 03:27:49.420
He's their dad.
I have to let them see him.

6493
03:27:49.460 --> 03:27:50.500
Why? Why do they have to?

6494
03:27:51.170 --> 03:27:52.740
To get another beating?
To be scared and broke?

6495
03:27:52.780 --> 03:27:54.300
Let him spend everything on drugs?
He'll ruin everything for you again.

6496
03:27:54.660 --> 03:27:55.360
People like him ruin things.

6497
03:27:56.100 --> 03:27:57.030
You don't know me.
Why are you doing this?

6498
03:27:59.420 --> 03:28:00.090
Because I can.

6499
03:28:11.550 --> 03:28:12.050
Bloody hell.

6500
03:28:20.250 --> 03:28:21.120
-Here's my car.
-Do you think it's him?

6501
03:28:21.160 --> 03:28:22.380
He kept a body in a freezer
and killed a politician.

6502
03:28:22.420 --> 03:28:23.470
-He wouldn't use his own car.
-Nice car.

6503
03:28:23.510 --> 03:28:24.770
-Is the Swedish police paid well?
-No, the same as in Denmark.

6504
03:28:24.810 --> 03:28:26.200
Don't jump to conclusions
about my wages based on my car.

6505
03:28:26.240 --> 03:28:27.490
Maybe it was a gift?
Maybe I inherited it or had savings?

6506
03:28:27.530 --> 03:28:28.760
I hope your professional conclusions
are more valid.

6507
03:28:28.800 --> 03:28:30.050
Read this.
It's Daniel Ferbé's latest column.

6508
03:28:30.090 --> 03:28:31.340
-The one that's a good writer?
-No, I said he's entertaining.

6509
03:28:31.380 --> 03:28:32.010
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

6510
03:28:44.580 --> 03:28:45.740
Hello? What's going on?

6511
03:28:45.780 --> 03:28:47.090
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-A Cadillac has a bomb in it.

6512
03:28:47.130 --> 03:28:48.130
Is it a black Escalade?
It's tied to a double homicide.

6513
03:28:48.170 --> 03:28:49.660
-Is the guy trying to kill himself?
-I don't think he was involved.

6514
03:28:49.700 --> 03:28:50.990
No, you're not going
anywhere near the place.

6515
03:28:58.500 --> 03:28:59.510
Help! Help!

6516
03:28:59.700 --> 03:29:00.400
-Take it easy.
-Please help me!

6517
03:29:00.440 --> 03:29:01.560
-Help me! Get me out!
-Calm down.

6518
03:29:03.360 --> 03:29:04.100
-Help me!
-The windshield is wired in.

6519
03:29:04.140 --> 03:29:05.090
The side windows are
connected to the electrical system.

6520
03:29:05.130 --> 03:29:06.520
The glass seems OK,
but there are wires everywhere.

6521
03:29:08.490 --> 03:29:09.160
We've got his contact details.

6522
03:29:13.500 --> 03:29:14.450
-What's going on?
-My mobile!

6523
03:29:14.490 --> 03:29:15.690
-Yes?
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

6524
03:29:15.730 --> 03:29:17.100
I need to know whether you were
on the bridge last night.

6525
03:29:17.390 --> 03:29:18.200
-What?
-Were you on the Öresund Bridge?

6526
03:29:18.240 --> 03:29:19.310
I was working.
I was here all the time.

6527
03:29:19.680 --> 03:29:20.680
-How will you get me out?
-I don't know, that's not my job.

6528
03:29:20.720 --> 03:29:21.790
-Do you know Kerstin Ekwall?
-Who?

6529
03:29:21.830 --> 03:29:22.720
Daniel? Did you do anything
apart from turn the key?

6530
03:29:22.760 --> 03:29:24.100
No. Everything locked.
The countdown started.

6531
03:29:24.140 --> 03:29:24.930
-Hello?
-I'm talking to the bomb guy.

6532
03:29:24.970 --> 03:29:25.740
Chairman of the City Council
Kerstin Ekwall.

6533
03:29:25.780 --> 03:29:27.230
-Have you written about her?
-No, I don't know.

6534
03:29:27.270 --> 03:29:28.350
-Have you been tipped off about her?
-No! What is this?

6535
03:29:28.390 --> 03:29:29.050
Get me out! Please!

6536
03:29:29.090 --> 03:29:30.210
Does anyone else
have a key to your car?

6537
03:29:30.250 --> 03:29:31.650
-No, I don't know.
-Can you reach it?

6538
03:29:31.690 --> 03:29:32.570
I don't want to die. Please.

6539
03:29:32.610 --> 03:29:33.890
-I don't want it to end like this.
-Daniel? You need to talk to me.

6540
03:29:35.080 --> 03:29:36.470
It skipped a minute.
What the hell did you do?

6541
03:29:36.680 --> 03:29:38.260
It was three, now it's two.
It was three.

6542
03:29:38.750 --> 03:29:39.680
Come one, hurry up.

6543
03:29:39.720 --> 03:29:40.980
Where are you going?
Stay here! Please!

6544
03:29:41.580 --> 03:29:43.170
Please! Come back!
Where are you going?

6545
03:29:46.440 --> 03:29:47.820
You need to talk to me.
Daniel? Daniel?

6546
03:29:48.230 --> 03:29:48.790
Is it a big bomb?

6547
03:29:49.730 --> 03:29:50.890
-I think so.
-You're not religious, right?

6548
03:29:50.930 --> 03:29:51.600
You're an atheist?

6549
03:29:51.640 --> 03:29:53.160
Everything will just stop. The body
won't have time to register pain.

6550
03:29:54.270 --> 03:29:55.690
-Are you sure?
-Don't look at the clock. Listen.

6551
03:29:55.730 --> 03:29:57.130
Do you know why your car
was used to dump two bodies?

6552
03:29:57.810 --> 03:29:58.620
-No.
-Think about it. Focus.

6553
03:29:58.660 --> 03:30:00.040
-Who did this to you?
-I've slagged so many people off.

6554
03:30:03.200 --> 03:30:04.260
Daniel? Are you still there? Hello?

6555
03:30:11.110 --> 03:30:11.630
It's clean.

6556
03:30:13.530 --> 03:30:14.690
Sorry about the drama, it's hard
to make oneself heard today.

6557
03:30:14.730 --> 03:30:15.510
I assume I have your attention now.

6558
03:30:15.550 --> 03:30:17.150
Our part of the world would be
wonderful if we solved our problems.

6559
03:30:17.190 --> 03:30:18.020
I would like to
point out five in particular.

6560
03:30:18.060 --> 03:30:19.680
This is only a beginning. We've got
interesting times ahead of us.
